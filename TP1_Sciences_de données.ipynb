It's the first book for a book club my two best friends in NYC and I are starting, and we gave ourselves a month to finish it.

It's an easy read, and no literary feat by any means, but it's a good read all the same. Its 300-plus pages fly by, and in them, you begin to feel like you're a part of the circus, understanding what it's like to work behind the scenes. It discusses the meaning of love, towards both humans and animals, and honour: what do you owe the people around you?The parts I loved best, though, and that touched me the most weren't the love story: I've seen too many of its kind before. No, it was the discussion of aging that got to me and made me cry so hard in the last two pages I woke my boyfriend up: what does it mean to age? What does your family owe you as you age? And what does your life mean when you're ninety-something, in a nursery home, and alone except for your memories? These questions terrify me: they wrack me with guilt and fear, and in raising them, this book became something more than a beach read.

We are first presented with Jacob Jankowski as an elderly man in a nursing home. The old coot may have problems with his short-term memory, but he certainly has a terrific long-term memory when it comes to remembering the details of his youthful days in a travelling circus. I thought that I had no interest whatsoever in the workings of a depression-era circus, including the care of the exotic animals and the various freaks and acts. However, the author depicts this unique microcosm of humanity with such passion and color that I found myself absolutely absorbed in the story early on.Adding to the historic ambience of this saga are the well-chosen photographs at the start of each chapter: a man with a deformed human growing from his stomach; a woman proudly showing off her bare upper extremities; excited people milling around the big top...It is the undercurrent of spiritual darkness that makes this story fly so high. Gruen depicts the battle between good and evil with stunning accuracy: the greed of Uncle Al; the brutality of August; the surprising kindness of the abandonned dwarf, Walter; and the meek vulnerability of Marlena and her animals.The scene with the drunkard Camel being told that he is dying of poisoning from Jamacai ginger extract is poignant. This, followed by scenes with Camel being cared for in a box car by Walter and Jacob. Stirring, because alternating chapters depict a now elderly Jacob in a similar position of helplessness.In sum, a GREAT book. Whoever thought that an elephant would carry such literary weight?

Lee\", \"helpful\": [1, 1], \"reviewText\": \"Every once in a while, there's a book that seems written for you. It speaks to you in a way books you love haven't. You don't just visualize the author's words, they leap off the page, and rather than watching the movie in your mind, you are living it. You feel the pain, the joy, the laughter. When the book is finished, you're more than disappointed. You feel invigorated, and you search eagerly through the author's books to see what, along the same vein, she has to offer. You search readers' recommendations to find the books that leave the same imprint on you. Inevitably, though the books satiate your appetite, they don't resonate in the same way. Welcome to Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants.In the prologue, we're privy to a murder. We see it as Jacob sees it, and tries in vain to stop it. Though the victim and murderer aren't named, as we're introduced to them, it becomes clear in our mind who filled those roles.Then we start from the beginning, in the midst of the Great Depression. Jacob is in class, during the final few weeks at Cornell preparing for his finals before he becomes a doctor of veterinary medicine.In a moment, the Dean will enter and change his path. Jacob was to go home and set up shop with his father, working with the animals in his town. Instead, he goes home to identify the remains of his mother and father. He sees the sign his father added to their on-site practice: Jankowitz and Son Veterinary Practice. After identifying his family, he visits the lawyer, who tells him he has nothing. The bank owns the house and everything in it. The explanation as to why his parents mortgaged the house shatters him. He returns to school to finish his finals and finds that he can't.Jacob flees and seeing a train pass, tries to jump aboard. Once on, he realizes it is a circus train. An old man, Camel, vouches for him and works to get him a job within.As soon as the boss finds he is Ivy League educated, degree or no degree, he becomes the animal man. With such a prestigious job within, he straddles the division between the higher ups and performers, and the lower echelon who helped secure his place.One performer in particular, Marlena, fascinates him. She reminds him physically of the girl he left behind at school, and emotionally captivates him. She matches his love of animals. Married to August, who has the boss' ear, she is off-limits, but a friendship develops anyway.Later comes Rosie, an elephant pilfered from a circus that has gone defunct. Rosie suffers August's wrath many, many times. Jacob is stunned by her human like qualities. Understanding, pain, anger, empathy, happiness all emanate from her big brown eyes.Following the story, I felt all of the emotions Rosie feels (except perhaps, the pain). Astonishment at the goings on to keep the circus running smoothly. The love Jacob develops for many people who help him in the course of creating a new life for himself, free of the memories surrounding his past. Sadness at the loss of animals, anger at the treatment of the animals and the red lighting of, as they're called today, carnies.The characters came alive to me, as did the setting. As soon as I finished this book, I eagerly went to Sara Gruen's website to read excerpts of other novels she had written. While good, they didn't capture me the way this did. And I wanted more of this. So I went to Amazon's recommendations Disappointedly, I moved on to Barnes and Noble. No dice. So I tried the next best thing. Research. I wanted to read first hand accounts of the circus the way it was back then. The more I read, the more I craved.Then, as though they knew my hunger, work offered me discounted tickets to the circus. I'm still debating. On the one hand, it's the circus. Elephants that feel things like people do! Horses that synchronize! How can I say no? On the other hand, it's not the 1920s. It's almost 100 years later. What if it's not the same? I mean true, we're in the middle of a depression (point 4 of pros: It's almost the same!). But people are categorically different than they were then. Theoretically, this extends to performers as well right?But alas, I have chosen to forego the circus at this moment, because I fear, like the recommendations of Barnes and Noble and Amazon, it may fall short. So I will hold onto the satisfaction this book gave me, and the hunger for more of the same. Hopefully, there will be another book that catches my attention like this one.

It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm.

Water for Elephants is of the former variety.  It's a quick read and a good read, but it is not a great book.Ms. Gruen was thorough in her research, so the reader does get some feeling for the gritty world of the \\\"train circus\\\", yet I felt when I finished the book that I had no clear sense of who the characters were.  Jacob is a nebulous character as a young man, and a shallow one in old age.  As for the rest of the \\\"cast\\\", well, when they are good they are very very good, and when they are bad they are...monsters.  Rosie the elephant is one of the more developed characters!The author doesn't seem to have a good ear for speech, either.  Any of the book's dialog could come from any character's mouth, for the most part, and some of the things Jacob says (or says in his mind) as an old man seem to land with a clunk.  They just don't fit.Add to that a slightly corny ending and a structure that comes out of any pulp murder mystery (old person recalling a murder, then going back to the start of the story and working back up to the murder...with a twist), and you get just a middling-good book.I am vehemently against the use (abuse) of animals in circuses, so I was happy to see that animal abuse was part of this story.  In fact, I think the author cleaned it up a bit too much (few facts about the orangutan and the chimpanzee, for instance..it's sickening what the higher apes were subject to, and still are).  What I think she could have cut back on is the gratuitous details about sex and the cooch tent.

Having finished, I'm mystified about the huge number of five-star reviews.I don't know much about circuses so I can't comment on the quality of the author's research efforts, although I see other reviewers have pointed out shortcomings. What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It's never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn't tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own \\\"love\\\" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don't want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that I strongly believe that Jacob, the narrator and main character, absolutely positively does NOT deserve the long and largely happy life he'll eventually get to lead. It's one thing to care about animals and less fortunate humans. That test, Jacob passes with flying colors.

The backdrop is the 1930's, and the book throws you into the era of carnivals, Prohibition, and the Great Depression.  You're led by slums with hobos, and everyone is dying for regular pay and something to eat.The story bounces back and forth between a man living out his twilight years in a nursing home, and his 23-year-old self... where circumstances find him joining a circus.  Life revolves around the train for these guys - they always travel in cramped space with all kinds of memorable characters.There are some great anecdotes so strange you'd think they were true.  My favorite was Rosie the bull elephant sneaking lemonade by pulling her stake out of the ground, and then being smart enough to replace it to avoid getting caught.The author respects the reader enough to let him figure out what's happening from contextual clues.  For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed.  You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz).

The author does a great job of the writer's maxim \\\"show, don't tell,\\\" revealing bits and pieces to fill in the details and background of characters over time. The main character, Jacob, is very funny, especially when he's a 93-year old with attitude. I felt so sorry for old Jacob after a while. I really wanted to get back to young Jacob and hoped for a happy ending. Without giving anything away, I was incensed at one point about what happened to old Jacob. I hated that part so much that I questioned all the favorable reviews. However, I must say that I'm satisfied with the ending and glad that I read the book. One bonus of the fact that it's a best seller: I was able to easily check this out from my local library after a few week's wait. No problem, I wasn't in a hurry.Regarding adult themes (beware potential SPOILERS below):I'm definitely NOT a fan of inserting graphic sex or nudity or swearing into a story for no reason. I prefer nice clean stories and think you really don't need to be explicit. However, I think the scenes in this story helped set the environment. They were typically treated with such humor that I laughed a lot and didn't mind them. First, young virgin Jacob guards a stripper while she performs. The striptease and gigantic breasts are described in vivid detail. Jacob's horror, amazement, and embarassment, having never seen a naked woman before shows he's really not in Kansas any more. That's the most explicit scene and it's really hilarious. There are a few other sexual situations, often mixed with drinking. The actual love making was left to the imagination. There's a little swearing. I found the beating of animals to be the most objectionable; Jacob, the animal lover, spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to help.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Rich Characters; Beware of Adult Themes\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1318377600, \"reviewTime\": \"10 12, 2011\"}\n",

The protagonist Jacob leaves his exams to become a vet after learning of the death of his parents and literally jumps aboard a train not knowing what kind of train it is or the kind of people on it.

They're right; the author does make you empathize with her characters.  When reading, I felt like I was right with the characters, watching them.  Many reviewers also emphasize and appreciate the book's unusual story.  The story really does have wonderful historical flavor.  Most of the characters participate in a 1930s traveling circus, and reading about this circus-society is entertaining and informative.Now, for all of that, the book's writing was nothing extraordinary.  While Sara Gruen tells a unique story, she is not a unique storyteller.  Her writing was too common for me, too similar to the writing styles of so many authors who are currently alive.As I was reading, I kept asking myself, \\\"Have I read anything by this author before?\\\"  The truth was, I had never read anything else by her.  But I felt like I had, because her writing style and word choices were nothing new to me.I imagine that, in a couple years, I won't be able to remember reading this book.  Perhaps I'll hear someone talk about it, and I'll get a feeling of deja-vu and say, \\\"Oh yeah.  I think I might have read something like that, at some point.\\\"Again, don't get me wrong; this was an engaging book.  It was entertaining, and I cared about the characters.  It was a good read, and well worth my time.  I happily recommend it to people who want to be entertained, and who might like to read about the circus.

Then it struck me that I was strongly remindedof Stephen King's \\\"The Green Mile\\\" when I read the old Jacob sections (very old man in an old person's home reminiscing about anoddly sentient animal while struggling to retain his identity in the face of unsympathetic caregivers). There's even the Popeye/Olive Oyl8-pager which is also referenced in \\\"The Green Mile\\\".  The Jacob/Marlena/August triangle was similar to the onein William Styron's \\\"Sophie's Choice\\\" (volatile charming Jewish man with a personality  disorder married to a younger sensitive woman, theyoung man taken under the older man's wing falling in love with the wife, resulting in violence and upheaval).But beyond that, the Jacob/Marlena love story was very poorly developed. Marlena never came together as a three-dimensionalcharacter.  When older Jacob talks about his wife and how she was his helpmeet at the beginning of the book, a weak, passive character such as Marlena was not the woman I pictured. I certainly don't understand why he fell so deeply in love with her. The ending was feel-good but nevertheless unsatisfying due to its lack of realism.The few plus points in this book are the quirky secondary characters such as Walter and Camel. The thematic setting of a traveling circus was also interesting but after reading the author interview included with the Kindle version, it seems a lot of the side plots and atmospheric color were lifted largely unaltered from actual instances the author read or heard about while researching the book.Given the hype, I didn't expect a book that I will barely remember in another month except for its similarity to other, better works.\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"summary\": \"Disappointing and derivative\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1324339200, \"reviewTime\": \"12 20, 2011\"}\n",

As many have said, it is a very interesting subject, but it could have been done much better.  I'll preface this by saying that I hardly ever read contemporary fiction, so perhaps I'm just not used to the modern style of writing.  Most fiction I read is from the era when a book could not be published if there was too much \\\"obscenity\\\" or if it was too graphic.Nonetheless, here's where I felt this novel fell short:As others have noted, it felt too contemporary.  Some of the language didn't seem to fit the times. I know the \\\"f\\\" word and other swearing has been around forever, but I almost never hear people from that generation use it. Also, young Jake laments being a virgin so much, but from talking with people who came of age before the sexual revolution, it was pretty much expected that one would remain that way until marriage. Even Hugh Hefner was a virgin until his mid 20s.The character of Jake was not convincing. I didn't get a good sense of who he really was as a young man, and the young Jake and the old Jake could have been two different people as far as I could tell.I didn't find the old Jake to be very symphathetic.  I felt bad for him for being trapped in a nursing home, but he gave the nurses a hard time and picked fights with another male resident which canceled out a lot of sympathy I would have had for him.  Also, I had trouble with Jake's situation.  If he couldn't even remember his family members who came to visit or the names of the nurses who took care of him, how come he could always remember the names and details of his fellow residents with no problem?A lot of reviewers had trouble reading the scenes about animal cruelty. I love animals, but I didn't have that much trouble reading them because I wasn't really convinced by the writing.As many others have said, the ending is unrealistic. Some people may not be bothered by this, but that's one thing that irks me.On the positive side, it was entertaining.

The story unfolds in two time frames from the first-person point of view of Jacob Jankowski.  As a twenty-three year old vet traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth and as a ninety-three year old man confined to an assisted living facility and repulsed by the sight of his aging body, his ever-sharp mind moves us effortlessly between the two time periods.  We are told he is about to reveal a secret he has kept hidden for seventy years----and what a story it is!In 1931, a tragic accident takes his parents from him and leaves him alone and penniless in the midst of the Great Depression.  The circus is both his salvation and his personal hell as he signs on to care for the animals.  Jacob and the characters he encounters are drawn so vividly that you will remember them long after the last page is read:  Marlena, the pink-sequined star of the equestrian act; her mercurial husband August who suffers with bouts of paranoid schizophrenia; Walter, the dwarf whose mother sold him to the circus, and Camel, the first member of the circus to befriend Jacob will all make you laugh and cry and cry again.  But it is Rosie, the lemonade-stealing elephant, who will steal a piece of your heart and cause you never to look at elephants in quite the same way again.Heartbreaking, poignant, and with a double surprise of an ending, this amazing plot unfolds with actual circus stories the author tells us in her end note that she has taken from real life.  Peppered with antique photos of long-ago circuses, this is an amazing book not only of circus life but of a man coming to grips with his diminished capacity and the aging flesh surrounding his ever-young heart.

The story is narrated by Jacob Jankowski, well the 93 year old version and the 23 year old version. The young Jankowski joined a traveling circus in depression-era America after the sudden death of his parents. With his veterinary background, Jacob is put in charge of the filthy, underfed and sometimes abused animals. The Benzini Bros. traveling circus is everything one would imagine a circus to be-dirty, crazy, and full of all kinds of different folks. Workers are apt to disappear in the night (thrown from the train, no longer able to be paid). It is obvious that Gruen did her homework on traveling circuses. Her terminology is spot-on and her vivid description is exquisite. The stand out characters are August the animal trainer, Marlena (his wife and a performer in the circus), and of course Rosie, the elephant. Gruen weaves together a story that is at times hilarious, heartwrenching, touching, warm, sad and so moving.

Destined to be passed among family and friends and back again, until the tattered, timeworn pages resemble the books beloved central character and narrator.Jacob Jankowski had studied Veterinary Medicine and was days from exams when his parents were killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, he hopped a train, never intending to \\\"run away with the circus\\\".... It was the midst of the depression and life was hard. Joining the Benzini Brothers Circus would change his life again. From town to town, day after day, set it up, tear it down-the freaks and geeks, midgets and clowns worked, ate, lived and often died together. The harsh conditions are made even more unbearable by the greedy manager and his insane animal trainer. Yet somehow, in the midst of despair, friendships and laughter persevered. Although much of the laughter was alcohol induced, during the height of the depression and prohibition, you took what you could get.The narrator's transition from the young circus vet, to the elderly, cantankerous nursing home resident, is a well-crafted, bi-lateral view that pulls the reader into this fictional world and never lets go. Whether in his twenties, admiring the beautiful equestrian performer, Marlena, and caring for the animals he loved-or in his nineties, complaining about the indignities of old age, the warm, quick wit comes through loud and clear. From the big top to the nursing facility Gruen's sharp, three-dimensional, fictionally fluid characters will have you laughing out loud one minute, mouth agape in disgust the next.Hurry, hurry, step right up, readers and book lovers everywhere. If you hunger for a reading experience chock full of every conceivable emotion, beautifully written and wholly engrossing, Water for Elephants is a wondrous world, where fact and fiction combine, delivering the most memorable and pleasurable hours, you will be spend with a book.

Part of its appeal was the promise of a circus story. And the story was very realistic in some ways, detailing how difficult and unrewarding (not to mention very dangerous)that life could be.Some of the most interesting and moving parts of the book were actually those that took place in the nursing home that Jacob now lives in, remembering his youth with the circus. The author did a great job in describing the sadness, loneliness and other problems that befall the very aged. Especially those nearly forgotten by their families. Their cold treatment at the hands of people who barely see these elderly souls as human is all too real, having witnessed this myself when working in this type of facility. And another reason why I got out of nursing.The love story was so-so, and years were wrapped up too quickly, at least for my taste. I looked forward to more stories of Jacob as the circus veterinarian. There was alot of potential there for interesting and moving stories about the animals, but that aspect was barely touched upon. Rather it was more about Jacob's obsession with the beautiful Marlena.I loved many of the interesting characters, but always felt I did not quite know them in spite of their frequent appearances throughout the story. Walter the dwarf as an example. He was one of my favorite characters. I found myself wanting more of his own story, but it wasn't there.I would recommend this as a light summer read, but would not look for more than an interesting diversion and brief look into the world of the circus folk when the animals were still transported by train and when the circus coming to town was the biggest news of the month.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Anyone looking for a quick, light read\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1282694400, \"reviewTime\": \"08 25, 2010\"}\n",

While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book.

I read a library copy for my book club, but after I finished I promptly ordered three copies: for my father, for a favorite aunt, and for my husband. I had to restrain myself from buying more.The book is narrated from the point of view of Jacob Jankowski, a ninety-plus year old man living in a nursing home. He is unhappy with everything about his current situation in life. He constantly flails against the every-present reminders that his body has degenerated so that he hardly recognizes himself. He's become the trouble-making curmudgeon of the facility because his mind is fully alive and has not degenerated along with his body.When a circus comes to town and sets itself up across the street, one of the old coots living in the same home brags that he used to work in the circus carrying \\\"water for elephants.\\\" This gets Jacob's ire up. He knows you can't carry water to elephants. They drink too much! The man is lying. Jacob knows the truth because he really did work in the circus. But those memories are long buried. Now that thoughts of this part of his past are awakened, he starts thinking about those halcyon days of his youth--a time when he learned quickly how to become a man.Thus the story of Jacob joining the circus when he was 23, during the heart of the Depression, when he had nothing in the world he could call his own except promise, inner strength, and fortitude. The world couldn't get any tougher for a young man. He learns quickly, and the hard way about many of the most important lessons in life, and he comes away from the experience a remarkably mature, whole, and admirable man.Two-thirds of the book deals with chapters about Jacob as a young man in the circus. One-third deals with Jacob in the nursing home. It is a proper balance and this construction adds to the tension of the story rather than detracts. You care about this man and root for him in both periods of his life.There is a marvelous feel-good ending, full of great humanity. When you finish, you are left with optimism and enthusiasm that sticks with you for a long time. I recommend this book highly. It is a book that can be appreciated by all ages; in fact, I think it would make an enjoyable and thought-provoking young adult title--but for those men and women who actually went through the Great Depression, this book is a treasure. Buy it for every one of those beloved survivors that you have in your immediate circle of friends and family. These people want for nothing material. It is hard to buy presents for them.

Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age.

Enduring his final days with other old folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read. It also, surprisingly, has a ton of character depth, and not just for human characters but for the animals Jacob tends. Particularly that of Rosie the \\\"dumb as hammers\\\" elephant that turns out to be much, much more than what she seems.The ending to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS was absolutely perfect, letting us know that even though the elderly can be crotchety, they serve a much greater purpose than to be wheeled around in chairs and told when, what and where to eat, drink, and think.

Jacob; who is incensed at this obviously false claim, and alienates himself from the rest of the residents, begins to relive, through a series of remembrances in his mind, his own experiences in the Benzini Brothers circus in his youth.With a cast as colorful as the balloons and flags that you can imagine flying over the bigtop of the Benzini Brothers circus, Jacob's internal narrative weaves a tale of love, loss, betrayal, and murder that is as fine a coming of age story as I have ever read.A thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"A Wonderful Read\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1212105600, \"reviewTime\": \"05 30, 2008\"}\n",

All of this is given to us from the senescent eyes of one \\\"90 or 93\\\", and it leaps through his semi-dementia-blurred eyes to his eyes as they were decades past -- the animated, vibrant mind of a large, strong and most admirable, but real, young man, Jacob/Jake Jankowski, a vetenarian, trained at Cornell University among America&#8217;s elite privileged classes, who fell into the depths of the morass of the Americana that one would expect circus-life to reflect.&#8203;Her novel is a much-heralded classic, as modern literature might define it, even if its prose are not of classical stature; the story that she weaves is captivating indeed.  She presents this historical-fiction view of circus life primarily as dialogue, very believable at that and so worth the time to read it, but it wants for more descriptive passages and philosophy to feed our starved minds.  Still, when she is of a mind to do so, she writes memorable lines, thus sprinkling her fascinating plot with tasteful, descriptive metaphors and similes which never impede the flow of the story line nor irritate the spellbound reader.  The plot drifts dreamlike between the disquieting realities of old age and its debilitating manifestations and the all-too vivid memories of circus life and the tragic and wonderful characters and griping events that then unfold.&#8203;Clearly, she has studied seniors and their halting routines in assisted living facilities, and she makes them all too real.  With this, I have two problems.  First, seniors' lives are boring and, worse, awash in sadness.  Second, for one of my age, they strike frighteningly close to home, increasing the appeal of some later self-extinction, a far preferable denouement than the gradual withering and atrophy that time assures.  As such, I rapidly flipped through the chapters dwelling on Jacob's painful, senescent existence.  On balance, I horoughly enjoyed learning so much about circus life in America some 100 years ago and all of the characters and plots of WFL.  Brava, Sara Guen.

He drops everything when his parents die and joins the circus.Jacob was a very easily liked character. I'd have to say the flash forwards were something I really enjoyed. Gruen's seamless writing between past and present is breathtaking. Reading the difference between an older Jacob as opposed to a young one was really intriguing. It was interesting to hear him describe how his body has aged from the vital, handsome young man he once was and how he sees himself as this decrepit old man now. It was so sad but quite hysterical at the same time.I didn't feel like I connected with Marlena too much. Yes, I liked her as a character, but I had a hard time seeing what Jacob thought was so special about her. A character I had a hard time deciding whether or not I liked, from the moment he was introduced, was August. In the beginning you want to like him when he's befriending Jacob, but when he starts slipping up and showing that he is really a very cruel man you immediately switch to despising him.Now Rosie... what can I say about Rosie? She is the cutest elephant ever! I love how Gruen wrote her with such a loveable personality. Well, really how she wrote most of the animals with such great characteristics. Bobo the monkey was also super adorable. Needless to say, something that I had a hard time with while reading this was the animal cruelty. A while back, I read an article from PETA on how elephants - most circus animals, really - are treated and it was just awful. So it was really hard reading it in gruesome detail. But hopefully, it'll make people realize how circus animals are treated so they can make a stand against it.Overall, Gruen has created a beautifully written novel. Her vivid descriptions and accurate portrayal of life in the circus during the Depression were captivating. Not once did I feel that the story dragged on and the ending left me satisfied. I also felt that the pictures of the circus at the beginning of the chapters were a nice touch.I can't wait to see if I love the movie as much as I loved the book.

It's an incredible book; brilliant, educational [to an extent] and highly entertaining.  By page ten I was hopelessly lost in its story, and fought sleep to stay awake and finish it.The story is told from the view point of a man named Jacob.  His viewpoint alternates between present time, where he is an elderly man in his 90's, in an assisted living facility which he despises, and also from the past perspective, as he recalls his days as part of a train circus in the 1930's.  When young Jacob's life turns upside down, he jumps a train, not realizing which particular train he jumped--and his world is changed forever.The story has a bit of everything; history, romance, animals, mental illness, corruption...its all in there, and its all in there in a way which leaves you incapable of putting the book down.  I learned a lot of things I didn't know before reading this book.  The intelligence of elephants is far higher than I ever gave them credit for.

He has few pleasures in life --- an astute and friendly nurse named Rosemary and his vibrant memories. As Jacob lies in his bed, drifting in and out of sleep, lucidness and dreams, the compelling story of his experiences as a young man unfolds in Sara Gruen's mesmerizing new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.The year is 1932. Jacob is 23 and just shy of getting his degree in veterinary medicine from Cornell when he learns that his parents have been killed in a horrific accident. Emotionally and monetarily stranded, unmoored and with nothing to lose, Jacob jumps a train and finds himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Starting at the bottom rung of the strict caste system within the ranks of the Circus employees, Jacob's veterinary knowledge quickly garners him a place near the top of the hierarchy, among the company of the hot-headed ringmaster August and his beautiful wife Marlena --- the all-purpose female star of the show.He also finds himself among the company of cantankerous midgets, gloriously endowed \\\"men's entertainers\\\" and a menagerie of exotic and soulful creatures. In her previous novels, Gruen has proven herself a master at depicting the uncanny and often astounding bond between humans and animals, and the scenes with Jacob and the creatures under his care are nuanced and lovely. Gruen paints each creature's persona with as much care and detail as she does for the humans, subtly illuminating the similarities and undermining the concept of human superiority. In the Depression-era setting of Jacob's tale, the survival of the humans is inextricably intertwined with that of the animals; they all live in a kind of chaotically symbiotic state where a star horse's sickness could spell bankruptcy and the chance for redemption lies in the acquisition of an elephant named Rosie.Exceptionally drawn as well is the development of a tentative bond between Jacob and Marlena. Jacob immediately is attracted to the lovely Marlena. She takes longer to reciprocate his affection, and throughout their cautious and hesitant budding romance the presence of Marlena's husband looms large and threatening. Gruen's pacing is excellent and the tension among Marlena, Jacob and August simmers and crackles before coming to a brutal and electrifying climax.The transitions back and forth in time, and the mundane events that unfold as Jacob moans and gripes through his days at the nursing home, could have been, in the hands of a less skilled writer, jarring and distracting, breaking the flow and drawing the reader out of the story. But while the crazed, dramatic and often spectacularly bizarre world of the Benzini Brothers is fascinating, as the novel progresses the reader becomes equally drawn into Jacob's present world. His disdain for his aged body and regret over the confusing array of relatives who visit him intermittently and whose names are permanently muddied in his mind is deeply poignant.Gruen spent years researching Depression-era circuses, and the breadth of her knowledge is revealed in all the tiny details that pepper Jacob's memories, but she also has a finely-tuned radar for the magic and mysteries of the human heart. The meat and madness of this novel may appear to lie in Jacob's memories of his younger self, but in her subtle exploration of Jacob as an old man, Gruen finds an equally compelling story.Readers may find themselves churning through this book at a rapid-fire pace, eager to see what lies ahead, then slowing down as they realize the pages are dwindling. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a book that can be read and reread, recommended and handed off between friends; it begs to be discussed and mulled over. With lines of startling beauty, haunting and evocative scenes and finely-drawn characters who dance off the page, readers can dip in and out of the novel, immersing themselves in Jacob's memories. The story and its characters will haunt readers long after they have resurfaced.--- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"A book that will leave any reader wanting more\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1149033600, \"reviewTime\": \"05 31, 2006\"}\n",

It's such a beautiful and unforgettable story in so many ways, I don't even know where to begin explaining what an absolutely gorgeous must-read this is.The story is told with two voices. It starts with Jacob, a full ninety or ninety and three years old (he can't quite remember), coming to terms with aging and being left on his own by his children, in a facility for the aged; whilst looking back at his time as a drop-out veterinary student when he joined the circus after his parents death. The second voice is of Jacob during the three months he had joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931, and follows the story of him and Rosie the elephant; and him falling irrevocably in love with another man's wife - a love triangle with a difference, for sure. Both these story lines, Jacob as an old man and twenty three year old Jacob, deals with different sides and facets of Jacob.Sarah Gruen is a master character developer. Main and secondary role players were vividly painted as multi-dimensional characters. She wrote them in such a striking way that before you can stop yourself, you've lost your heart to quite a few of them, including the animals. Rosie, of course, is the star in this book and if nothing else, her trials and tribulations as well as her spectacular sense of humor, had me laughing and wiping tears at the same time.If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book yet, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. As great as the movie was, the book touched me on so many more levels than I could've imagined. I was riveted by the author's writing and the skilful manner in which she pulled me into Jacob's reality. I experienced so many emotions along with the various characters, and at times felt I could strangle August for what he put Rosie, Marlena and Jacob through.Most memorable line which made me smile: \\\"Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of.\\\"The well-executed, fast-paced plot - fraught with twists and turns - also had moments of humor woven into it, and I finished this book feeling breathless from the anticipation, excitement and sheer excellence of this imaginative story and its realistically-sketched characters. It was clear to me that the author did in-depth research for this novel. If you don't purchase the book, at least watch the movie.

I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her. It's a shame, because I love the idea, but it just did not cut it.If you want to read some great non-fiction about sideshows and entertaining attractions, check out Ricky Jay's books.

Up to about page 190 I found it to be an enjoyable read and had mentioned it to friends. Alas from page 190 onwards I found it losing its grip...maybe it's too long?Most of the characters are underdeveloped to the point that much of the conversation between Jacob and the various circus folks could essentially take place between him and one other - they all sound the same. I've read peoples comments about the trials and tribulations of the characters living through the depression - it doesn't come anywhere close to a classic dealing with the same period, The Grapes of Wrath.The stampede at the end is a tad too contrived, surely the animals would be tearing themselves, and all around them, limb from limb given that they've attacked their handlers in the past. Same goes with Jacobs disappearance from the old peoples home - again too contrived.There is the makings of a great story here but I don't think Gruen is the one to tell it. The opening scenes have Blackie under the authority of Camel and then 3 months down the road Blackie is ejecting Camel from the train? Sorry it doesn't seem credible. August seems like a nasty piece of work but his paranoia was certainly well founded in the end; we're told that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia but does anyone help him out with it? Just seems a convenient way for Gruen to add a villain in to the mix...and I have to question would circus folks even know what it was in the first place, and surely his wife would have helped him try and figure it out...\\\"I left my husband\\\"...\\\"why?\\\"...\\\"he was a paranoid schizophrenic\\\"...\\\"ah, OK, cool\\\"...isn't life a little more complicated than that? And his ultimate demise and how it was conducted is a little far fetched.I guess I'm feeling let down - the book starts off well but alas doesn't maintain the quality. Also found the interview with Gruen to impart nothing of much substance and the \\\"Questions for Book Groups\\\" to be of a nature beyond the level of this book - Grapes of Wrath certainly gives rise to concerns about the depression, compassion etc. but this book doesn't. Alas it didn't deliver and I don't think I'll be reading anything else by Gruen based on this.Have to say that I'm a little disgruntled at the thought of Gruen has a couple of dollars of mine and undeservedly so; if I was Gruen I'd be asking myself whether the ending was worthy of the potential shown earlier in the book. Unfortunately, it's books like this that have me buying books secondhand, and for the most part reading the \\\"classics\\\"; they're classics as they've withstood the test of time - I can't imagine this book doing so. For authors I like I'm more than happy to buy a book new and in the process pay money to the author, but my disappointment with this book is such that I don't think Gruen deserves any reward for it and makes me realise what a financial risk one is making buying new books from untried authors.Why are there so few contemporary authors out there who are deserving of the praise that seems to be lauded upon them so easily these days? For those of you looking for a book that covers the darker aspects of humanity and their situations along with some wonderfully humourous moments then give \\\"Suttree\\\" a read by Cormac McCarthy - it's not the easiest of reads but rewards effort.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"What's all the fuss about?\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1189296000, \"reviewTime\": \"09 9, 2007\"}\n",

As he comes to this realization, Jacob stumbles upon the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus train and hops aboard. He quickly secures his place on the show as the menagerie vet, a position that will change his life forever.Sara Gruen weaves an incredibly realistic tale that allows the reader a rare glimpse into the prohibition era circus lifestyle. The amount of tension throughout the book is always palatable. I often found myself clenching my jaw and holding my breath by the end of a chapter. August is a particularly well-developed character, frightening in the most realistic and entirely plausible way. There is a sense of impending destruction and collapse that builds with each paragraph.This tension is gracefully relieved every few chapters by visiting Jacob, age ninety (or ninety-three), in his current state as a resident at an assisted living facility. Through the telling of Jacob's present story, the reader reaches another level of understanding and can comprehend the meaning of Jacob's earlier experiences in entirely new ways. The tale would be much less satisfying without this continuation of the story, however small it may seem.An issue that must be addressed when talking about Water for Elephants is the treatment of animals. Some scenes in the book are very difficult to read, but it's worth reading through. You will fall in love with so many of the animals as though they're human, and you will be satisfied with their redemption.For me, Water for Elephants receives 5/5 stars.

This man is the main protagonist of the novel, who recounts his story from his last days in vet school whose life trajectory takes him to the circus after a tragic incident.  The novel is rich with visual imagery of circus life - the animals, the workers, the performers, the props, the train travel etc - and as rich with the depressing conditions of a nanogenarian living in a nursing home - the daily struggles to handle basic life skills, relationships with the staff and other residents, and, saddest of all, the knowledge of the sense of loss of one's memory, and with that, the eventual loss of connection to relatives.  The narrative moves quickly and aggressively, taking the reader back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, with each venue progressing dramatically towards its conclusion.  The main charcater, Jacob, is sympathetic, and you root for him all the way, accompanying him along his travails of adjustment to circus life and his love interest.  You get wrapped up in the drama and stay along eagerly on the ride.Here are my minor objections(The first is directed at author and editor.):  In a span of two pages the author uses the exact same phrase regarding some anticipated emotion from different characters.  It's jarring to read, and you go back to see if you misread it - but no.  Not a big deal but it interrupted the flow.  Bad enough, but the same phrase (or almost the exact same phrase) appears again near the end of the book about the same emotion, and, once again, I'm jarred and lose the focus of the story.  It seems like an amateurish mistake by author or editor.The other problem I had was that, at times, some of the circus characters were borderline stereoptypical/cartoonish, as if the protagonist is one of a few only real people.  Finally, the concluding chapter had some elements to it of a Hollywood happy ending, with an implausible change of attention from tragedy to negotiation.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"very Good Novel with Some Minor Flaws\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1200614400, \"reviewTime\": \"01 18, 2008\"}\n",

Wasser\", \"helpful\": [6, 13], \"reviewText\": \"The archetypical American novel features a solitary protagonist undertaking an odyssey in which he/she confronts both physical and moral challenges and through which he/she emerges with a renewed spirit, transformed by the crucible of confrontations with adversaries, both real and imagined.  Sara Gruen's engaging \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life.  Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero.  \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is a triumph  --  of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.The innocent Jacob, on the threshold of graduating from Cornell veterinary school and returning to the Midwest to practice medicine with his father, is shattered by the sudden accidental deaths of his parents.  Unmoored from his past and unable to focus on his final examination, he abandons his former life the moment he jumps on board a passing train.  To his astonishment, he has leaped into the midst of a traveling circus, and, thanks to the flinty care of several roustabouts, manages to gain employment with the tawdry Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus dominated by a sadistic ringmaster and populated by a cast of characters, admirable and evil in equal proportions.  In a manner of weeks, Jacob immerses himself as the circus \\\"vet,\\\" forms abiding friendships, falls is love and faces moral dilemmas that tie his conscience into Gordian knots.Some critics have likened Jacob to his biblical counterpart and praised the novel for its allusions to the Bible.  In my opinion, Jacob mirrors a less sanctified model, Huckleberry Finn.  Like Huck, Jacob flees familiar surroundings, flaunts social norms, befriends outcasts and risks his personal safety in order to adhere to a hard-earned sense of conscience and social responsibility.  Both Huck and Jacob confront mendacious adversaries, rejoice in life on the lam and re-invent themselves.  Like Twain, Sarah Gruen writes with inordinate respect about the dispossessed and with painful awareness about the inexplicable capacity for the human heart to do well in the midst of spiritual darkness.  As Twain has written  --  and as Gruen affirms  --  the source of humor is pain.Even the title bespeaks our capacity for misrepresentation.  The elderly Jacob, shunted away by his family in a assisted-living nursing home, excoriates a new resident who has claimed to have carried water in buckets for elephants when he was a youngster.  Aware of an elephant's enormous drinking capacity, Jacob knows a lie when he hears one.  And well he should.  The entire purpose of the traveling circus is deception, an enterprise where rubes are separated from their money by gaping at mangy animals, staring at sideshow freaks (many of whom are frauds) or being serviced by \\\"exotic dancers.\\\"  Falsehoods, illusions and duplicity are the moral big tent under which circus performers enchant Depression men and women hungry for escape.  The central conflict of the novel rotates around Jacob's involvement with a married woman and the peculiarly disturbing aspects of her husband's mental state.  This conflict is rife with secrecy, duplicity and tormented twisting of ideas of right and wrong.It is no surprise that this novel is a best-seller.  Written with extraordinary narrative drive, populated by characters who truly represent our national character and animated by a young man whose journey for self-discovery is our own, \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" intimately involves us in Jacob Jankowski's search for meaning.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Huck Finn move over, Sara Gruen has created a soul-mate in her majestic novel\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1187136000, \"reviewTime\": \"08 15, 2007\"}\n",

His body betrayed him years ago and Jacob now fears that his mind isn't far behind. Shuffling along miserably behind his walker, he's living out his final days in the nursing home and hating every minute of it. Just another invisible senior citizen who's family and the world as a whole has forgotten about.When the circus comes to town and sets up its Big Top tents across the street Jacob comes alive and through a series of flashbacks begins to tell us his life's story. Taking us back to when he joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth, a traveling circus he toured with during the great depression.At the age of 23 Jacob had a predictable future set out ahead of him, one that certainly didn't involve joining the circus. However with his parents untimely death and the bank foreclosing on his family home Jacob soon finds himself homeless, heartbroken and mentally quite unable to sit his final veterinary exams. When an exotic, animal filled train steams toward him Jacob doesn't even think. Flinging himself aboard the boxcar and inadvertently changing his destiny forever.I absolutely adored this book, alternately falling in love with both Jacob, the crotchety old man and Jacob, the young, moral and penniless circus veterinarian. Water For Elephants transported me to another time and quickly became one of those books I never wanted to end.Author Sara Gruen has researched the depression era circus life down to the smallest of details and I feel that this captivating and vivid story will appeal to almost anyone.Filled with action, adventure and a sweet forbidden romance there is also a fascinating sideshow of secondary characters including a clever Polish Elephant, a grouchy little person as Jacob's roommate and a cruel and schizophrenic animal trainer whose wife Jacob just happens to fall in love with. All of this has been wrapped together with a compelling and innovative behind the scenes look aboard a travelling circus train. Showing us more often then not the darker side of circus life after the big top closes down. This is a love story, a life story, an animal lover's story but above all it's a circus story and who of us hasn't dreamed about running away and joining the circus at some point in our lives?

Initially, I did not have any interest in reading this book because it involved a circus and I am not a huge fan of circuses. But at the insistence of some friends, I picked it up and began reading. Boy am I glad I did!Jacob Jankowski is a young man who is thrust mercilessly into the aftermath of the cruelties of life. Despite his circumstances, however, he is a good and honorable man and his compassion and honor shine through on every page of this book. He is a character that reader's immediately fall in love with and can relate to on some level or another. The story itself grabs you instantly and takes you back to a time where traveling circuses were the biggest events in town.Set in the 1930's, Water For Elephants offers a glimpse into a very strange and wonderous world of circus folk during a time when many, if not most, of the country was unemployed and doing anything they could to earn a buck or at least a meal. It was fascinating to read of the lifestyle of the circus workers and how they were treated, how they related to one another, how they treated their animals and what they thought of the townspeople they traveled the country to entertain.Water For Elephants is also a story that tells of the love and life of Jacob and Merlena and their love for the animals that they come to know while working with them in the circus. The book is beautifully and vividly written, the characters well developed and easy to love (or hate as the case may be) and the animals' antics, especially Rosie, will make you laugh out loud.Water For Elephants is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it!\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Awesome!\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1257811200, \"reviewTime\": \"11 10, 2009\"}\n",

There are so many varied responses to this book that the author must be in heaven to get so many responses to this book.I first heard of this book last spring when a fellow Amazon reviewer told me that I \\\"just had to read it.\\\" I wasn't that inclined since the price was not favorable and the waiting list at the library was too long. However, in my book club, it was the November book to discuss. So when I saw it on the table at the local bookstore for buy three, get one free, I snapped it up. It is not a decision that I have regretted. It is one of the better entertaining books of fiction that I have read this year, if not one of the best. And I read a lot.There are some disaparities in this book as with others, but I think people tend to forget that a work of fiction is simply that, a work of fiction. Not everything's going to \\\"mesh together\\\" as in real life. That's why you read nonfiction if you like everything in its proper place and order. This book is simply a fanastic tale of a man facing the end of his life in a dreary nursing home setting, and reliving some of the best moments of his life. A young orphan who happened to jump the train to get away from the tragedy that was his life happened to be on a circus train. He didn't plan to run away to the circus, he just stumbled on the circus train while grieving. And stayed. Fell in love with the most beautiful girl in the world who is happened to be married to the ringmaster. What a story!This novel alternates between Jacob's present and past ~~ he relives the first three months of being in Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and seventy years prior, he was the Benzini Brothers' vet, taking care of the underfed animals of that show. He worked with all kinds of people and animals. It was an exciting life ~~ how many people do you know that lived a life like that? Marlena is the wife of the psychotic ringmaster who alternately abused his wife, his animals and co-workers. Rosie is the elephant bull that Uncle Al, the owner of the circus, bought for a song, hoping that Rosie will be the biggest draw to his circus.The descriptions in this novel are lavish. One can see the sawdust in the air as the big top was put up. One can see the cotton candy being spun. One can feel the humiliation of an old man having to take a shower under the watchful eye of the nurse in the nursing home. One can feel his love for the beautiful show girl. And all of this is tied together beautifully, both past and present. It is a glimpse into a life of a man.Why didn't I give it a five star? Simply because I felt that the endings to both stories were rushed. I did not expect it to have such happy endings since the stories were more gritty and realistic.

Wilfong\", \"helpful\": [3, 4], \"reviewText\": \"Water for Elephants is an interesting text because it is not especially well written, the story is pure soap opera, and yet it is an enjoyable read that at times evokes a long gone era. I think it suffers from overly effusive praise and so many readers are bitterly disappointed once they get through it.First, let's look at the strengths of the novel. I enjoyed the evocations of circus and train life. Gruen clearly spent some time working on these descriptions of circus life and there are little Depression era details that were nice historical jewels for the reader to mine. Also effective was her characterization of old Jacob. His voice was witty and biting and he provided the most pleasure of any character in the text. Chapter nineteen of the novel is the saddest depiction of rest home life I have read in literature. A man is forgotten by his family, and the scene is heartbreaking.Now to examine the reasons why this book is unsatisfying. First off the characters from the 1930s parts of the novel are some of the weakest characterizations I have seen in a book in a long time. They are stock characters at best, and the villains are the mustache twirling men from melodrama. It is hard to care about any of the characters because they are so transparently fake. Even more distracting then the weak characterization is the incredibly insipid (and modern sounding) dialogue Gruen puts in their mouths. She has such nice historical details in the setting of the text, why couldn't she also use it in the dialogue?Many readers have found the ending unsatisfying, and although it is ridiculous, it fits the novel so I won't argue with it. The cloying depiction of animals is also a little beyond the pale, but again, I simply had to come to terms with the novel for what it is. It is popular fiction. It is a melodrama you will get caught up in. And for those purposes it is adequate.

The other half is about Jacob's life as a young man in the circus.  Jacob runs off to join the circus, literally, when he is just about to graduate from college.  Devastated by the loss of his family and fortune, he turns to the only thing he knows and loves--the one connection he has to his veterinarian father--the animals.  Jacob gets a job 'watering the elephants', and one grouchy elephant in particular, as he works as the circus animal veterinarian.  Jacob also has the really dumb luck of falling for Marlena, a trick horse rider.  Marlena just happens to be married to the circus boss, a sadistic man who beats her and the elephants.  The whole situation is a powder keg waiting to explode.Interspersed with this is the story of present-day Jacob and his longing, so tender and sad, that pulls on the heartstrings.

The most enlightening aspect of the story was the education I received about the hierarchy of employees within the circus.  From an outsider who has always been taught (but never believed it) that people in the circus where of lower class than others, I had no idea there were different ranks of people within the circus.  Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane.  From the beginning the book was colorful with characters.  The transitioning between the past and the present with the main character was an interesting transition.I try to approach a book with an open mind and throw other opinions out the window.  I am pleased I have done this because the people that I know who have read this book have ranged from horrible to excellent.  I found this book entertaining and engrossing. It was never a book that I just could not put down, but I enjoyed read it.  Because the era in which the reference of the circus occurred the comparison of food lines and the great depression was evident.  Although the inhumane treatment of the people and animals undoubtedly occurred during this time period, it wasn't easy to read it.  Although the hierarchy of the class of people was evident within the circus, it was not unlike how society actually was during this time period.  The author clearly did research to solidly base the sad realities of the treatment of people and animals during the depression era.The author weaved a story with vivid characters and animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light.  Sara Gruen's engaging \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life. Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero. \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is a triumph -- of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.After all of this being said, I am on the fence as to whether this book lives up to all the buzzes and even deserving of being made a movie.

The story begins as Jacob prepares to sit for his veterinary exams at Cornell University. He receives word that his parents have been killed in a car accident and things go downhill from there. He ends up as part of a circus and the next three-and-a-half months are mostly a living hell, except for Marlena.The story goes back and forth between the present time in the \\\"assisted-living\\\" home where Jacob resides and his memories of the past. His children/grandchildren/great grandchildren take turns visiting him, but first-born son, Simon, misses the most important day of all. In the end, this misstep creates for Jacob, and the reader, a most satisfying end to a moving and heartwarming life story.

I thought Jacob's stories, both in the past and in the present, were extremely well written. I found his innocence and charm as a young man quite enchanting. Wouldn't it be grand if all young men were as courteous and as sweet as the young Jacob Jankowski? I also really liked the crotchety 90-year old Jacob, whose temper tantrums and emotional outbursts were most certainly justified. The loss of independence is something that we all fear, even more so when a person has lived a long and full life only to be left alone in a senior's home to die.I also thought Marlena's character was well-written. Divorce in the 1920s and 1930s was unheard of, and I can only imagine how awful it must have been for a woman to realize that she had to endure the rest of her life with someone she despised. I found myself wondering when she was going to make the decision to live for herself, rather than do what everyone expected her to do. Then again, she had already made that decision once by leaving her family, so I expected that she would come to the right decision at some point.As for Gruen's research into circus life during the Depression, I think that she did a fantastic job. America during the Great Depression is such a fascinating piece of history, and when you add the excitement of an all-American circus show to the mix, it becomes ever more so.

He lives in an assisted living facility, where he's forced to eat food he doesn't like and socialize with residents who are younger, but far worse off, than himself.  As he faces the realities of his advanced age and begins to deal with the ravages of time on his body, Jacob reflects on his younger years, when he worked as a veterinarian for a traveleing circus known as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  He joins the circus at 23, at the height of the Great Depression, right after his parents are killed in a car accident and right before he graduates from veterinary school.Most of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is written in flashback, taking readers back to Jacob's beautiful and strange years with the circus during the 1920s and '30s.  While working for the circus, Jacob falls in love with two girls:  Marlena, the circus's star performer, and Rosie, a bull elephant no one else seems to want.  But there are complications, of course:  Marlena's husband, August, is the \\\"equestrian director\\\" of the circus--and he's also very possessive, obsessive, unpredictable, and cruel, not past beating both his wife and his animals if they don't adhere to his commands.  But Jacob's love for Marlena and Rosie transcends all this, and it will change his life; he has no way of knowing how much. Now, as an old man near the end of it all, trapped in a body he doesn't recognize, Jacob clings to his memories, to the vestiges of his younger years, as if they are a life raft.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of Jacob Jankowski's life--gritty, surreal, full of vibrance and love. In her third novel, Sara Gruen brings to life a dazzling cast of characters in a vivid landscape little-explored in contemporary fiction.  The world she has created for her readers is, well, otherworldly:  magical and strange and startlingly real.  Her Depression-era train circus resounds with authenticity; she borrows anecdotes from her research and uses circus slang to add a sense of immediacy to the experience. Her prose is simple and unpretentious, poetic in its own way.  Simply put:  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is just lovely!I can't say anything bad about WATER FOR ELEPHANTS; I think it deserves every bit of praise it receives.  Jacob is such a compelling character, so utterly well-drawn.  His vibrancy as a young man jumps off the page at you; so does his frustration with being trapped in a withering body as an old man.  Gruen's tale moves back and forth in time seamlessly, and it's obvious how much she cares about her characters--even the non-human ones.  Her love story is impeccably researched, alternately heartbreaking and hopeful, romantic and violent. And the ending?--it's absolutely perfect.  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS took me somewhere no other piece of fiction ever has--and I can honestly say I enjoyed every page of the journey.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"A FANTASTIC novel!\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1155686400, \"reviewTime\": \"08 16, 2006\"}\n",

I appreciated the difficulties and heartaches of dealing with old age and time passing, with loneliness and loss of certain freedoms, with death. Of course, I also loved how the two main characters grew, fell in love, and fought against the obstacles to be together.It actually reminded me of Sparks' The Notebook. So, if you liked that and you like the circus, this is definitely the read for you. And for those animal rights activists, I didn't find the scenes of animal abuse that offensive.

Ebeling \\\"ctlpareader\\\"\", \"helpful\": [2, 2], \"reviewText\": \"I could not help but notice that reading Sarah Gruen's Water For Elephants is very much like watching the movie \\\"Titanic.\\\"  First and foremost, each offers big historic pageantry, with a rousing \\\"you are there\\\" quality.  Each features two parallel narratives from the same protagonist, one in advanced age, one in a defining passage in young adulthood.  Both feature a romantic triangle involving a young woman who is a victim of her times stuck in a marriage or engagement to a cruel powerful man and the young man of no means who becomes her soulmate and savior.  Both send the young man to a fancy dress dinner in a borrowed tux. Both create insular worlds that are set apart from the rest of the earth, one by an ocean, the other by the train-bound peripatetic exotica of circus life, and within that insular world there is a class structure inspiring social commentary.  Both the Titanic creators and Gruen took admirable artistic risks in going to material that nobody else was treating and both did their homework on historical detail.Water For Elephants is about circus life in the early years of the Great Depression.  It successfully captures glimpses of the American experience and opens up the closed world of the circus that is at once a very dangerous place and a warm sanctuary.  Gruen does not spare the gritty reality of disregard for human and animal life.  She succeeds in creating a very delicately balanced community that can slide into disaster if shoved off balance.  Thinking on the living conditions she portrays, sometimes you have to ask, why would anyone stick with this mess?  For the narrator, Jacob Jankowski, it is love for animals, friends and the aforementioned girl.Water For Elephants is, like the Titanic, a large scale entertainment but when it comes down to it, there is no one line or character that is surprising (except perhaps for the elephant).  The book is well crafted but not artistic.  It may have been very different in the hands of John Steinbeck or EL Doctorow.  That said, Gruen gets points for following through on her inspiration and delivering a book that is very atmospheric and historically interesting, with some social commentary mixed in.This edition comes with a worthwhile interview with Gruen and a book club discussion guide that is more like a junior high English class test.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Big Hearted\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1250640000, \"reviewTime\": \"08 19, 2009\"}\n",

Jacob Jankowski is about to finish up his veterinary degree at Cornell University when he learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash. Stunned by this awful and sudden turn of events, Jacob completely blanks while taking his final exams. He walks out and wanders out of town in a complete daze, eventually jumping a train. It turns out he has jumped the circus train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob pretty much instantly falls for Marlena, one of the star performers. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the animal manager, who is, as we come to find out, a paranoid schizophrenic with erratic behavior problems. The story focuses on these three characters as the circus train makes its way around the country, performing in various cities. Along the way, the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob befriends his reluctant roommate, and tries to save an ailing friend from being tossed from the circus.This is a really interesting and moving book. It's really fascinating to read about daily circus life and how things worked. And it's a touching story about a smart elephant, a compassionate vet, and a forbidden love. I do wish there had been some more charater development for Rosie the elephant, though. Also, the story is told in retrospect, from a present-day Jacob who is now in his 90s. Every few chapters, the story skips back to present day, and the nursing home-bound narrator. I felt the story would have worked a lot better if it had just stuck to the circus part of the story. The present day interjections were distracting. Other than that, this was an excellent book.

I flew straight through it in just a few intense sessions, eyes locked to the page over an hour at a time.  Couple of quick book comparisons immediately come to mind.  First, I'm reminded of the great line near the beginning of \\\"Life of Pi\\\", that informs the reader that they are about to hear a story that will make them believe in God.  I wrapped myself around that line and read in hopes of the book keeping that promise.  It's a bold promise, so I reward the book for its effort, but I'm not sure it lead to any true converts.  We get a similar sentiment in the beginning of \\\"Water for Elephants.\\\"  Jacob pulls us in by insinuating that he's about to tell us a secret he's kept for over seventy years.  Again, I found myself lured into the book's \\\"Big Top\\\" to find that secret.  And much like an old-world carnival, I found my main attraction and enjoyed all of the book's turns and sideshows.Another book comparison that comes to mind is with \\\"Iron Weed,\\\" a Pulitzer Prize winner in the eighties.  Like, \\\"Iron Weed,\\\" this book does really an excellent job of submersing you in the feel and sense of being flat broke and in dire straights, trying to negotiate survival during the Great Depression. During a long stretch inside the world the book creates, I could literally feel the dust and dirt being kicked up by the roustabouts and workers, as the tents went up.  Gruen took my into those crammed, dirty box cars, and murky late-night binges.  I was there.One more favorite from the book.  The author somehow manages to make the internal world of a ninety or ninety-three year old man, trapped and forgotten in a nursing home, just about as interesting as the glitz and glamor of the show and the drama it unfolds.  That's no easy feat, but she does it well.  I was left thinking about aging, long after I had let go of the circus.  Jacob's thoughts about how senility sort of creeps in and his explanations of his two worlds, and no longer being sure where one ends and the other begins, stayed with me.

However, the backbone of the story seems to be a sort of iconoclasm. The Sterling images of the circus often inculcated in us during childhood are challenged by images of violence, animal cruelty, and graphic sexuality. However, the fact that this book unearths the dark side of the early twentieth century circus speaks less to its quality than to the fact that our society all too often allows commercialism and popular mythology to shape our images of the past. Simply challenging false notions held by society contributes very little to the value of a story like this one. In the end, the tone of the book takes on moods which can change violently from the darkly cynical to the unrealistically optimistic (the ending of the book feels impossible, illegal, and unsafe). Sentimentality, rather than a meaningful exploration of human emotion, dominates the scenes of the assisted living facility, although as noted above, the fact that those scenes also bring to light the continuing need for respect to the elderly does serve to redeem them to a decent extent.The story is, on some level, a \\\"forbidden romance\\\", and on this level, it has many failings. The rapidity with which Marlena falls for Jacob seems more indicative of a woman torn by the violent nature of her relationship than a woman in anything approaching love. The way in which August is killed seems to do nothing but Grant a legitimacy to the relationship via Pacidermis ex Machina, and to tie up loose ends.All in all, this isn't an awful book, but it seems to be the type of story commonly found in book discussion groups for all of two months before being rapidly forgotten. There is no real draw, beyond a handful of tense and well-written moments in the last quarter of the story.For the Kindle edition, images work surprisingly well, and I have no real complaints about formatting.\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"summary\": \"A New York Times Bestseller Unlikely To Stand The Test Of Time\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1359158400, \"reviewTime\": \"01 26, 2013\"}\n",

It's rare that I read a novel and become so engulfed with the story, but from the first page, I was hooked. The way in which Gruen has the protagonist of the story, Jacob Jankowski, switch back and forth between his 22-year-old self and present day 90 (or 93) year-old self is both creative and effective in capturing her readers. Every single scene has intensity and vibrancy. The juxtaposition of the elderly Jankowski and the young circus worker Jankowski posed a humorous yet almost sad setting for the story. Readers would be crazy not to fall in love with his character.Though fiction, the novel represents the lives of circus workers back in the 1920's and 1930's and gives insight to the gruesome conditions the men had to live in, and the constant struggles that they faced everyday. Each chapter begins with a photograph derived from circuses back from the time Jankowski would have worked. The photos truly show the lives that these men led and let readers see not only imagine how things were. Though the historical value of the novel was fascinating, the forbidden but passionate relationship between Marlena and Jacob was the most captivating portion. The constant secrecy from August and the fear of being revealed created an incredible emotional reaction for me.The corruption of the novel and the intensity of the characters made this novel a hard one to dislike. In my opinion, it has to be one of the best books written in the past few years.

However, he does remember a very interesting part of his life.  It comes about one day when the news that a circus is in town and one of Jacob's fellow nursing home inmates brags about having worked at a circus and giving water to the elephants.  Jacob knows the old man is full of it.  After all, Jacob once worked at a circus.  Rewind seventy-something years, to the 1930s, amid the Great Depression.  Jacob is twenty-three, just weeks away from getting his degree in Cornwall University to become a certified veterinarian.  Then he receives the news that his parents died in a terrible accident.  He also discovers that they had no money -- they had invested every last penny on Jacob's Ivy League education.  Distraught, Jacob runs away.  By accident, he ends up on a train, destination unknown.  He discovers that the train is actually one that carries a traveling circus.  One thing leads to another, and he ends up working as a sort of unofficial caretaker for the animals.  He meets August and his wife Marlena.  Jacob learns many secrets to life as a circus performer and worker, meets lots of interesting people, and encounters some very unsavory things.  August, for instance, is a very unstable, unpredictable person.  He is abusive to the animals and insufferable one moment, and completely charming and obliging the next.  The way he treats the animals, especially Rosie, the new performing elephant, makes Jacob sick, but he can't do anything about it.  The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth has its awful moments, but things get worse for Jacob when he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena...I like the way Water for Elephants changes from Jacob's present-day narrative as a cynical old man with early signs of dementia to his days as a nave young man and his struggles with wanting to fit into the Benzini Brothers and wanting to lose his virginity.  The way his voice and narrative change is clear and precise and you get drawn into this unique and at times quirky novel.  The backdrop of the Depression is wonderful and believable.  The secondary characters are compelling, especially Walter, August, Uncle Al and Marlena.  August is a horrible person, and the scenes centered on his abuse toward Rosie the elephant are indeed sickening.  It's a good thing Gruen spares us from too much information in terms of the actual abuse.  Rosie sounds adorable and I loved it when she was in the scenes.  I very much enjoyed Water for Elephants.  It's very moving and entertaining.  No wonder it became a #1 New York Times bestseller!  Even though the NYT list has never influenced my reading, especially since the stuff that makes the top list is mostly trash, it's nice to see that readers get it right every once in a while.

It was strongly recommended to me by several people who said it was \\\"a great story\\\" so I was expecting something that would truly captivate me and pull me in. For me, it simply fell short.I think that a tremendous amount of time and effort went into the research involved for this book and that should not go unnoticed. If you're looking for a book that clearly depicts the Great Depression and/or circus life during that time period - by all means you should pick up the book. I do not know a tremendous amount about that time period to tell you if it was fully accurate, but I feel that it did give me a pretty good picture of what circus life would be like in that era. The photographs installed at the beginning of each chapter also did a great job connecting the story with the reality of traveling circuses of the time. The language probably could have corresponded a bit more, but in terms of the spirit and energy of the book versus the time period in which it takes place, I think it was pretty spot on.However, I really had trouble connecting with the characters. They simply did not seem like well-rounded, real people to me. I understand that the characters should be eccentric considering they are individuals traveling with a circus, but not to the point where they should seem artificial. Their emotional reactions to various tumultuous situations seemed unrealistic - based on having experienced similar situations in my life. The psychological repercussions would have been huge for a lot of the major conflicts that occur in the book - especially during the time of the Great Depression - but I did not feel the degree of inner struggle within the characters was well represented throughout the story. The characters would get sad or angry, but they seemed to sedate their feelings pretty darn quick.The depiction of the main character in his old age, however, seemed more realistic to me. I thought the scenes in the nursing home were very well done and true to life. The characters in these parts also seemed more believable to me. However, I was pretty disappointed in the ending. It seemed contrived. I will not get into it too deeply, however, so as not to spoil the story.I genuinely feel that Sara Gruen is a great author and did a good job with the book, I just feel that the character development was lacking. In terms of painting a picture of the environment though, she did a fantastic job and it's a book worth reading, if only for the descriptive element of it.

Days before sitting for his final exams, he shockingly learns that his parents had been killed in an tragic auto accident.  To his dismay, he stunningly learns that due to the economic downturn of the Great Depression, his father's veterinary business and whole estate is essentially worthless.  His parents mortgaged everything to pay for his education.Distraught and penniless, Jankowski aimlessly wanders from the Cornell campus, eventually hitching a ride, hobo style on a train that was home to the Benzini Brothers circus.  Mentored by a alcoholic but kindly circus worker named Camel, he starts working caring for the animals in what was known as the menagerie.  He will assume the duties of a true vet and work under the schizophrenic equestrian director August.  Augie is married to celebrated equestrian performer Marlena, who Jankowski falls deeply in love with.\\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is essentially a look back into the 3 1/2 months that Jankowski worked in the circus revealing the seamier underbelly of circus life from the side unseen by the \\\"rubes\\\"  or circus-goers.

Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him \\\"unshaven\\\" with the implication that what he really means is \\\"unclean,\\\" you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and \\\"chick flicks\\\" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a \\\"twist\\\" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, \\\"Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it!

When both of his parents die in a car accident, Jacob is so torn up, he runs away in the middle of his final exams and joins up on a circus train, the Benzini Brothers' Most Spectacular Show on Earth. His life in the Depression era on a traveling circus are intercut with the present day, 90-something year old Jacob reminiscing about the past and dealing with one of the most difficult obstacles: life.I Liked:With the movie due to appear in theaters soon and the recommendation from a friend, I decided to hunt down an audiobook and listen. And, in short, am I glad.Before I started reading, I thought (based on either the blurb on the back cover and the movie trailer) that the book was a love story dressed up in circus costumes in the vein of James Cameron's \\\"Titanic\\\". Poor boy meets wealthy attached (married) girl, both fall in love, blah, blah, blah. Throw in some random animals, circus acts, and there you go.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't the case. The characters were beautifully drawn and real, from our protagonist and narrator, Jacob, to his bunkmate, Kinko/Walter, to our love interest, Marlena, to our antagonist, Big Al. The story focuses more on the circus life than on the love between Marlena and Jacob. The setting was beautiful and intricate, the ambience was spectacular and grotesque (sometimes at the same time!), and I truly felt transported back into the past. Not to mention, there were many tearjerker moments--real, emotional moments, not those written just to elicit a pornographic emotional response.Jacob was a good narrator. I felt his pain as his parents died, I understood his awe at Rosie, I felt his disgust at August's disgusting behavior. But my favorite character was Marlena, and I can definitely see why Reese Witherspoon was cast as her. She is spunky, fun, mature, and spirited. My heart broke hearing how her family abandoned her just because she married a Jew (she was Catholic), and I hated how August treated her. Walter was also another great character. It was terrible how his mother basically sold him to the circus just because of his dwarfism. And the scene where he almost loses Queenie really brought home how alone and lonely this poor guy was.So many novels these days seem to be window dressing for a love story, but this novel isn't one of them. Sure, a cornerstone of the novel is about Marlena and Jacob, but there is much more going on. A man's journey into coping with death. The horrors of the circus. How hard life was back in the Depression. Escapism. The trials of growing older. The need to belong. The story deftly wove back and forth between younger and older Jacob, and I found myself interested in BOTH sides, not just one or the other.I Didn't Like:In places, the novel is very graphic. I didn't care for when Jacob barged in on someone AHEMing or hearing about the two ladies AHEMing Jacob.I would have liked to have seen a little more of the acts that went on in the circus, though I suppose those would work better in a visual medium.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:A few f-bombs, amongst milder profanities.Jacob is interested in losing his virginity. While drunk, two women try to perform sexual acts on him, but Jacob vomits on one. Two characters make love; \\\"self love\\\" is shown once or twice.The story opens with a character about to be impaled. Camel is crippled because of his drinking. August is abusive to his animals and to others. Workers have been thrown off the train, a practice called \\\"red lighting\\\".Overall:This is an impressive book, one that totally bucked all my prejudices and preconceived notions. It was able to do what a lot of books can't: make me care about the characters and take me to another \\\"world\\\". I only hope that the movie, when it comes out, can do it justice.

So if a feel-good book like this can affect me so enormously, just think what it'll do for those of you who like this kind of stuff!  Only partly joking here; but truly, this is one magnificent work of literary art.  Inside glimpses of life in a 1930's circus are so intimately written and ring so true, that it's hard to believe Ms. Gruen isn't 90 years old, writing memoirs.  Each character is so artfully rendered that you care, and care deeply!, about every single one of them.  You love them or hate them, with equal measures of intensity.  Add the super special treat at the beginning of most chapters of real photos from these old circuses, and you have just a jewel of a book.  Obviously, I'm drooling all over myself in this review, but I can't recommend it strongly enough, to everyone, no matter your preferences in reading material.  I took a chance and am SO glad I did.

Water for Elephants has got to be one of the best reads for anyone that likes animals, circuses, and a very wonderfully flowing story.  Working in or for a circus, especially in past years, had to be one of the most grueling and tough jobs to tackle.  Sara Gruen makes the reader smell the circus smells, taste the midway foods, and be in the ring with the animals as they entertain.  I have not been to a circus since I was a teenager, which is MANY years ago.  Water for Elephants took me back to those days reminding me of some of the things I saw and smelled.His family placed Jacob Jankowski in a home for old folks because none of them wanted to \\\"have\\\" to take care of him.  Sad, but true.  Jacob is not sure if he is ninety or ninety-three years of age.  He only knows his age is somewhere around that range.  Jacob hates the other old people in the home, hates the food, and hates the nurses that treat him like he does not know what he is doing or saying.  This is no life for Jacob Jankowski!The story then goes back to when Jacob was in Cornell College studying to be a veterinarian.  He was shy about women; wanted nothing to do with them socially.  Jacob thought he must be the worlds oldest male virgin.  Jacob does well with his schooling until one day he was called out of class and told that both of his parents had been killed in an automobile accident.  Jacob, of course, was crushed, mentally and physically.  This couldn't be happening to him.  His parents had been paying his way through college so he figured he could continue his education with whatever his parents left him.  His father was also a veterinarian with a good practice.  Jacob was beside himself when he was told that all the property his parents owned was being taken because of no funds to pay for the bills.  It turns out that his father bartered with his customers as they paid him in chickens, eggs, animals, or whatever they had, but not money.This upset Jacob so much that he just took off walking and walking until he came to a rail track that had a train moving that he was going to jump on regardless of where it was going.  Thus Jacob began his circus life when he jumped that train and met other circus performers and roustabouts.  He had no idea what lie ahead.  His inclusion into the circus life was difficult, as the circus does not like young rubes being around experienced circus people.  When they found out he was \\\"almost\\\" a veterinarian, they were elated, as they had no one to medically care for the animals.  This gave Jacob a ticket into circus life.As I said originally, the author makes you feel as though you were in the circus troupe as they raised their tents, did their shows, ate the food available, got paid when there was money, running away from the law when one or more in the circus caused a problem with the law or local authorities, traveled on the circus train never knowing for sure where they would end up, putting up with the circus owner and top management that treated most of the help like dirt.Of course there was much in the book about personal lives of the circus employees and owners.  Also how the circus obtained more animals and equipment legally or otherwise.  It is an eye opener for anyone to read.  It makes one wonder how these circus people existed in those days of traveling and living such an uncertain existence.The story does occasionally go back to Jacob in the home in which he is so unhappy.  The circus comes to town and sets up right next to the home, making Jacob so excited to be so close to the circus, even though it is not one of the ones he worked when younger.  The days passed so slowly as he waited for his family to come and take him to his big visit to the big top.I doubt anyone could read this book without coming away with a great understanding of those old circus days and what they meant to the people that worked that hard life.  You will know that Sara Gruen put much time and effort in her research for Water for Elephants.  You WILL enjoy this book.

Robertson\", \"helpful\": [362, 394], \"reviewText\": \"Although it is only April, I predict that Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen will be one of the best books I read this year.  Gruen has proven to be an amazing storyteller.Water for Elephants is told in the first person but from two different perspectives--Jacob Jankowski at 23 years of age and again, at 93 years old.  Gruen seamlessly weaves the chapters between past and present.  Jacob at 23 is finishing up his last semester at Cornell Veterinary School when a family tragedy causes him to flee.  He finds himself on a train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in 1931.  Needing a vet, the circus hires young Jacob to tend to their menagerie.  Jacob at 93 resides in a nursing home where he laments the curses of old age, the passing of his wife, and the waning affection of his family.  The arrival of a visiting circus triggers a flashback to his youthful circus experiences.1931 is a hard time for almost all Americans, and the circus workers are as hard hit as any.  Most are one step away from being homeless and jobless.  Conditions on the circus train are harsh for most.  Many workers go weeks without being paid, and they tend to disappear during the night when times are tough (management has them thrown off the train).  The menagerie is often times treated better than the workers.  But the circus does provide three meals a day and a place to sleep--even it if might mean a horse blanket on a train bed floor.  Jacob discovers very quickly that he's just about the only advocate the animals have and he must battle a ruthless owner (Uncle Al) and a crazy animal trainer (August).Any circus has more than their fair share of interesting characters, and Gruen's circus is no exception.  In addition to Uncle Al and August, there is Walter (the midget clown), Marlena (an equestrian with whom Jacob falls in love), and Grady and Camel (workers).  One of the most sympathetic characters in Water for Elephants is Rosie, the elephant--who shares more \\\"human\\\" characteristics and feelings than some of the circus bosses.  The tender-hearted Jacob quickly grows to manhood as he is forced to protect both animals and coworkers from abuse and worse.Water for Elephants is a delightful, moving book, and the ending was a very pleasant surprise.  Also, if you want a special treat, listen to it on audiobook.  The two readers, David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones, did a wonderful job of bringing both Jacobs (young and old) to life.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"One of the best books I've read this year...\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1176854400, \"reviewTime\": \"04 18, 2007\"}\n",

With a name like \\\"Water for Elephants\\\", and a historical background as interesting as the Great Depression, I had expected to read a book about the difficulties of the circus life and how the historical backdrop influenced these characters' lives.  What I got instead was a sentimental love story dressed in the glitz of a historical novel, a slightly better-written version of a Nicholas Sparks novel.At the start of the book, the circus has just come to town; and that effectively got our querulous 93-year-old narrator to start reminiscing about the good old days when he used to travel with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth as a veterinarian.  As it turned out, 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski was one exam away from getting his veterinarian's degree from Cornell when both of his parents were killed in an automobile accident.  After having handled all of his parents' affairs, and after having found out that he's now virtually penniless, the grief-stricken young man walked out of his class room and hopped on the first train that crossed his path, a train that turned out to be the circus train owned by a ruthless circus owner, Big Al.  For the next 3 1/2 months, Jacob travelled with the circus as a veterinarian, taking care of the animals in the manegerie during the day and traveling from city to city by night.  It was also during this time that he met Marlena, the cricus performer who turned out to be the love of his life, and her cruel but charismatic husband, August.  The three soon developed the kind of complicated relationship that any romance reader worth his/her salt will know how it's going to turn out.The greatest strenght of this book definitely lies in the author's portrayl of circus life as they were in the early 1930's.  With Big Al, August, and Walter the midget - the author has assembled a memorable cast of secondary characters that the readers will either love to hate or root for.  Walter, in particular, turns out to be a character with much more depth than initially meets the eye, and how his relationship with Jacob evolved and developed was one of the highlights of the book.  Equally interesting was Jacob's interactions with Rosie, a mischievous elephant that ended up being the catalyst for a key event that will change Jacob's life.  I've never been a fan of the circus, but reading about Rosie's antics made me want to grab a handful of peanuts and head to the zoo.Regrettably, our main protagonists in the featured love story aren't nearly as interesting as the secondary or even the animal characters in the book.  Jacob, in particular, has about as much personality as a gnat. Throughout the book, he was grouchy as a 93-year-old, and whiny and ineffectual as a 23-year-old.  Some of the atrocities committed against the members of the circus - all in the name of survival and profit - is heartbreaking.  And yet, other than to rant and spend time sulking and moping around in his stockcart, Jacob was useless when it comes to helping his friends or even taking fate into his own hands.  Ultimately, his life turned out the way he wanted it to not because of any initiative on his part, but pure luck.  Since the book was told in first person from Jacob's point of view, the character of Marlena was even more under-developed than Jacob.  All we know is that she's this beautiful girl in pink sequin that caught Jacob's eye the day he joined the circus and from then on he was lost. There certainly wasn't enough interaction between the two to make their romance remotely convincing.  And for a book whose central theme is the great forbidden romance between two people who met at the wrong time, this is a great failure.So, in summation, if you are expecting to read a meaty historical that provides insight to what the circus life was like back during the 1930's, skip the book.  If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks and looking for a sentimental love story to tide you over until his next publication, this may just be your cup of tea.\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"summary\": \"An interesting but ultimately disappointing read\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1303084800, \"reviewTime\": \"04 18, 2011\"}\n",

The story of an almost veterinarian finding his way in the crazy life of a train circus. And the story of love.

Rosie is intelligent and caring and through her vigilant eyes and silent actions is a magnificent portrayal of loyalty and friendship.  Walter the clown is another character to whom I grew very attached.  He is the typical insecure cynic whose interior consists of nothing but a soft shell.

The first involves a young, depression-era  veterinarian who loses his parents in a car accident just days before taking his final exams. His father, also a vet, had mortgaged his practice to the hilt to pay for his son's Cornell education. At loose ends the boy hooks up with a circus.The second has to do with the same man, now a miserable nonagenarian confined to a senior citizens home. He gets into a \\\"fight\\\" with another old man who claims to have carried water for the elephants. You don't carry water for the elephants; you take the elephant to the water. One would think the first story would be more compelling since the circus is a world of its own with its own language and culture, but it's really the ninety-year-old who wins our hearts. His \\\"people\\\" come to see him every weekend, but he doesn't really know who they are; he doesn't remember if he's ninety or ninety-three. But he does remember the circus.The circus story is kind of hokey. Almost immediately the young vet, Jacob Jankowski, falls in love with Marlena, the star of the equestrian act. The problem is she's already married to the animal trainer, who just happens to be a paranoid schizophrenic. He's also insanely jealous. Then there's the elephant, Rosie, who only speaks Polish; Camel, an alcoholic  roustabout who helps Jacob get a job with the circus; and Kinko, the dwarf, who at first is an enemy of Jacob's but later befriends him when Jacob cures Kinko's dog Queenie of the trots. The book does come to life periodically when Sara Gruen uses real circus lore. For instance, Uncle Al, the circus owner, loves freaks. He takes the circus train on a wild ride when he has a chance to employ Charles Mansfield-Livingston, a man with a parasite twin growing out of his chest, whom he calls Chaz.Gruen also provides numerous real-life circus pictures, one of which is especially titillating. She got them from STEP RIGHT THIS WAY: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDWARD J. KELTY and WILD, WEIRD, AND WONDERFUL: THE AMERICAN CIRCUS AS SEEN BY F.W.

His faculties are starting to have issues, but he, again, is smart and together enough to realize this as well.  His story of a strong, vibrant will trapped in a failing vehicle is incredibly poignant, and, if a writer were talented enough, could make for a captivating book on its own.The \\\"easy\\\", high-action story of the circus makes up most of the book, but is tempered very well by the internal musings and frustrations of the second.All in all, very satisfying and highly recommended.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Two Great Ideas in One\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1261440000, \"reviewTime\": \"12 22, 2009\"}\n",

The movie: The two are combined into August. Verdict: The movie got it right. Uncle Al is an under-developed character in the book. The movie gives us one villain who is more menacing, especially as portrayed by Christoph Waltz.The book: Marlena gets pregnant with Jacob's child. The movie: She does not. Verdict: The movie steered clear of the hackneyed device of having the woman in the pair of star-crossed lovers get pregnant.The book: We are taken back and forth in time from the present of the old Jacob to the past of the young Jacob. The movie: Scenes with Jacob as an old man bookend the story. Verdict: I have mixed feelings about this one. The passages focused on Jacob as an old man are poignant, insightful and empathetic. Some of the best storytelling on being old I have ever read. I would enjoy an entire book based on those passages.

It is a romance: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back (whoopee).  In the afterword the author explains that she was wanting to do a story about the photographer of circus', but she got caught up in all the rest of the circus history and it became this book.  It is worthy and good.  The second is of the same man in a nursing home, or some such place, who sort of does not belong there.  He has lived his life and remembers it well.  The instigation is the circus has come to town!!The chapters are defined by when is the story being told.  Sometimes it is now: he is old and ornery; the next one, he is remembering his life in the circus.  The value is in the perspective: as an old man, he has problems, but he deals with them, somewhat; as a young man he grows up and finds the love of his life.  It is always wonderful to read a story of love growing and becoming the be all to end all.  But real love is of the animals, horses, elephants, orangutans, chimpanzees and doing something constructive.

When we meet Jacob, he is in his 90s, living in a nursing home and reliving his days with the Benzini Brothers circus. It was through a chance encounter after the death of his parents that caused him to leave veterinary school and put his fate with the circus.I was really surprised by how quickly the story captured my attention. The novel jumps back and forth from \\\"now,\\\" where we see Jacob dealing with the trials of old age, and \\\"then,\\\" as he remembers his days with the Benzini Brothers circus, and how those days formed him into the man that he would grow to become. The sequences are fluid, though, and you find yourself easily swept along with the story. Sara Gruen's prose is amazing; I found myself on several occasions holding my breath, I was so wrapped up in the story. Gruen clearly portrays her characters emotions and captures each of their voices and personalities perfectly and her portrayal of the lives of the circus folk in the 1920s-30s was very grim. It was amazing to me that so many people would live that kind of life, but I guess when that was the only work to be had, they'd take what they could get.Gruen seems to have done her research as well. Even though the Benzini Brothers circus is fictitious, I think it was clearly influenced by any number of circus' in operation at the time. She also makes reference to several actual circus events (such as the Hartford Circus Fire of 1944 and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus train accident of 1918). Even down to the band playing \\\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\\" during an emergency, Gruen seems to have done her homework on circus life.If you haven't read this yet, I'd really recommend it. I'd had the book on my shelf since it was released (I was caught up in the buzz, but never got around to actually reading it) and after 2 friends mentioned it a couple weeks back, I decided to take it off the shelf and give it a try.

They all point to the darker side of our nature, while they put on a show that denies the fact.

Gruen writes the most enjoyable kind of historical fiction, focused on a fascinating time and setting that the reader probably knew next to nothing about before starting the book. In this case, the scene is the American traveling circus of the early 1930's, just after the start of the Depression. The protagonist operates in two time periods, as a nonagenarian in a current day \\\"assisted living facility\\\" and flashing back to his days as a young veterinary student who due to circumstances beyond his control ends up serving as the vet for a traveling circus. Gruen intended to imagine various vignettes for the book, but in her research and interviews with circus veterans discovered stories from real life that were even better--a real-life case of truth being stranger than fiction. The assisted living facility is inevitably less interesting than the world of freaks and geeks in a circus, but Gruen handles the voice of the aged just as deftly as that of the young vet.  The book is enhanced by actual pictures from various circus archives.

It took longer to set the stage than I expected, but the book kept me listening all the way to the end.

It was a surprising unexpected ending, that made it all the more worthwhile for waiting for it.The setting was a seedy travelling circus set in the Depression era in the US.  Some parts were sad, the disposable people to the circus owners, and the treatment at times of the animals.  The reader brought it all together--the main character, and I truly enjoyed this book--not one I would normally be intersted in or buy.I might have been able to skim by the slow parts if the book were in paper form, not audio, or if the chapters were shorter in the audio book.

I was amazed and enlightened by all of the details of an early-20th century circus and all of its inner workings.Secondly, the novel is told from two different perspectives.  One is a 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski, who is an ivy-leage educated animal doc and recently \\\"orphaned\\\", while the other perspective is a  90(or 93)-year-old Jacob, whose days are spent in a nursing home, longing for the days of his youth.  Both perspectives are equally compelling and entertaining, and they come together to reveal mysteries about the story in the end.Speaking of mysteries, I loved that there was a twist that totally caught me off guard in the end.  These always make for great pleasures if done right, and Gruen's  surprise delivers a punch at the end that I wasn't even looking for.I already am waiting for the mention of film rights to this one.  It screams movie all the way through.  Not just because of the amazing story and characters, but also for the potentially incredible set design, costume design, and stunning visuals.  The elderly Jacob would be a great role for someone in the winter of their years and the flashbacks between then and now just yearns to be filmed.Finally, the characters in this book sold me.  Every one of them is a real treat.  As you might imagine, the characters in a circus are, well, real characters, and those from The Benzini Brothers circus is no exception.  Jacob, upon accidentally joining this troupe, discovers real evil, unlikely friendships, and the love of his life.  The characters are not exaggerations or caricatures like another unnamed circus novel I have read.  These people are empathetic, realistic, funny, and fascinating creations you won't soon forget.Get a copy of this novcl today.

I will say that the circus atmosphere was conveyed with incredible, and apparently accurate, detail and I was impressed by that. I could see and even smell everything, and the book movingly conveyed how desperate times led to desperate people clinging to even the most degrading employment with a third rate circus.  However, the characters seemed to be straight out of a romance novel, with the exception of old(even he's not sure how old he is)Jacob, who was funny, disarming, feisty and touching -- whereas the young Jacob was pretty vanilla, too obviously a \\\"nice guy\\\" with little personality.  In contrast, Old Jacob's voice was so clear and true and I really cared about him;he was funny and sad, his memories bittersweet, his longings compelling.  I also liked (but who didn't?)Rosie the elephant, who had twice the personality of anyone else in the fleabag circus, with the exception perhaps of Walter, the dwarf.  The plot depended on coincidences that I had problems believing, and I found myself caring more about the animals (which I admit isn't unusual for me!) than I did about any of the people.  However, I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sentimental stories, who loves happy, pat endings, who doesn't necessarily want a book to convey great ideas, but who is touched more by the romance rather than the writing.  Those of you will, as have many others, it appears, love this book.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that, it's just that those kinds of books are simply not what I prefer to read.

In and out of a small town, usually an overnight, the performers and working men put on a show that involves animals, freaks (the dwarf and the fat lady), the clowns, and all manner of circus act entertainment including a tent just for \\\"gentlemen\\\" and other delights.Jacob's parents died just as he was about to write his final exams in veterinary school at Cornell University. Because of the hard economic times, his parents mortgaged everything to pay his tuition and thus he was left grief-stricken AND penniless. He ends up joining the Benzini Brothers by an accident of good timing and, because of his vet training, he ends up hired on to care for the horses and other animals. Along the way, the circus owner purchases an elephant named Rosie; she becomes a special part of this story.Author Sara Gruen weaves a tale of hooking the rubes into coming to the show, second-rate performances that managed to wow the audiences, boozy nights, in-fighting among those with the train, backbreaking work, and other fascinating details of the traveling circus. Jacob quickly assimilates into the hard life and makes the mistake of falling in love with Marlena, one of the performers who has a sadistic husband. Not only cruel to his wife, August also beats and mistreats the animals. What will become of Jacob and the rest of the members of this group of misfits, outcasts, and showmen?Readers will savor the story and applaud the somewhat maudlin ending.

The prologue is of the climactic event in his life in the circus, and then the rest of the book alternates every few chapters between his first hand accounts in the present in the nursing home and his first hand accounts in the past as a youth in the circus. The scenes from the present in the nursing home force you to sympathize with a man whose body is old but who is mind is young and the struggles associated with such a circumstance, while the scenes from the past in the circus are a window into the past that show you who this man used to be.This book had a captivating beginning, and satisfying ending, but my only problem, and the singular reason I didn't give it five stars was that in the middle, the story was just a tad slow. However, don't let that discourage you from reading it because, as you can see from my title, that only warranted a half-star reduction from me because this really is a great read as a whole whether you love or hate the circus and I recommend it full-heartedly to lovers of a good story.PS: For a novel with a completely different plot, but with similar execution (telling the story by alternating between present and past) and a fantastic five-star story, try Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"A 4.5 star book with only one tiny problem...\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1177891200, \"reviewTime\": \"04 30, 2007\"}\n",

You really feel that you know Jacob and all the performers in the Benzini Brothers Circus.  The story revolves around a love triangle all set within the context of the depression and circus life.  This does not come across at all like a romance novel.  The story is well-crafted and keeps the reader's interest.  All key items I look for in a book.  There were a few fights intermingled to keep my sense of action / adventure happy too.Pros:o well researched depression era circus lifeo wonderful characters who you grow to know and loveo full telling of story - you don't feel like anything was left outCons:o none big enough to comment onOverall - I highly recommend this book.

Yet I deduct a star because of the lack of attention to detail regarding the male protagonists and the verbage of the time.

In the days of the big top, there were lots of menial jobs that kept those who wanted to be part of the circus busy from before dawn into late into the night, even if those jobs often involved nothing more glamorous than shoveling up the remains of an elephant's snack.Water for Elephants starts with an elderly (at least 90 years old) Jacob Jankowski remembering snatches of his past as he frets over the indignities of living in a nursing home while his children ignore him except for token rotating visits on Sundays.  One memory in particular stands out, a violent memory that he didn't share with anyone for over 70 years.Most of the book moves through flashback into the 1930s when America was broke and people were starving.  Into this challenging world, Jacob has high expectations as he finishes up his veterinary training at Cornell.  But the hand of God intervenes, and his life will never be the same.He soon finds himself serving in any role that he can get at BENZINI BROS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH (as the rail cars read).  This isn't the big time.  It's just surviving by staying one step ahead of the local sheriffs while not delivering on promised acts and providing entertainment for men that has nothing to do with being a circus.  This circus doesn't even have an elephant.Much of the story involves the nitty gritty of how circuses operated in those perilous times.  It's a story that encompasses lots of cruelty, deceit, and harshness.  In fact, it's enough to make you wonder why you ever dreamed about running away to join the circus.  So if you would like to keep that dream shiny, perhaps this wouldn't be the best book for you to read.At the center of the story are three people and one elephant.  Marlena is the queen of the circus, the star of the equestrian act that involves first 12 and later 10 horses.  She's married to the volatile August who runs the animal acts.  When Jacob becomes involved in caring for the animals, Jacob is invited to dine and party with the couple.  The relationship becomes more complicated when Jacob finds himself drawn to Marlena and repelled by August.  When the circus buys an abandoned elephant that seems unusually stupid, the equilibrium is destroyed.Ultimately, the book is about responsibility and loyalty . . . qualities that are more important in and taken more seriously by the circus world than by the \\\"rubes\\\" who attend the circus.  The message will serve as yet another indictment of our modern world which favors efficiency over doing the right thing.The book is beautifully illustrated with vintage photographs of early circuses that nicely match the story line of Water for Elephants.Unlike many authors of such historical fiction, Sara Gruen does a good job of keeping a few surprises up her sleeve.

I loved the narrators, they really added something extra to the story. Also this story is meant to be told orally and listening to it really makes it all come to life.I was a bit worried when I decided to listen to this book. I don't usually like books that involve animals, mostly because of the guaranteed heart fail. Not only does this book have animals, it is set in a circus. Having worked as a zookeeper, I learned some of the not so nice things that happen to circus animals. Then add to it, the story is set during the Depression. All of these had me cringing a bit. But who hasn't dreamed of running off to the circus?I was hooked in the first few minutes of the reading. I could tell that it would be a story I would lose myself in. I have to say though I was a little annoyed with the music playing in the background. Particularly with the older narrator as it made it difficult for me to hear him clearly.Oddly enough, it was the scenes of the older Jacob that had tears coming to my eyes, rather than the animals. It sucks to be old and his story is probably far more common than not. Though I did cringe every time August had a scene with Rosie. I was also a little shocked at the debauchery that took place at a circus (today it is such a family event).The descriptive nature of the story had me feeling like I was there at the circus. I could smell the popcorn. hear the cheer of the crowd, and when I closed my eyes I was in the menagerie with all the sights and sounds that come with a tent full of animals. More so than any other audio book I've listened to, there was a mini movies running through my mind.I went to see the movie a couple of days after finishing the book. I don't usually like to see the movie version so soon after finishing a book because the details of the book are so fresh in my mind. But I have to say, the movie was so well done that I fell even more in love with the story. The movie left out the parts that I found annoying in the book (in particular the back and forth between the old Jacob and young Jacob).

The beginning reminded me of Stephen King's \\\"The Green Mile\\\".  The author obviously had to do a great deal of research into circus life during the depression in order to write this book.  What she found does not make a pleasant story.  Being an animal lover, the cruelty displayed toward the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, really disturbed me.  I still have a hard time believing that Jacob, who had nearly received his degree as a veterinarian and loved Rosie, would not have done more to prevent it. The cruelty displayed towards the employees was just as bad.  Railroad goons would actually push workers off moving trains in the middle of the night rather than pay them.  I thought the affair between Jacob and Marlena was not as torrid as it should have been.  Rosie was my favorite character - she was described in human terms which made the cruelty more difficult to endure.  In the end, both the peon workers and Rosie got even.

Dusty, stinky, hard work, low pay, railroads, animals escaping, fat ladies, dwarves, clowns, all of it.  But the heart of the book is the story of Jacob, a young veterinarian (who hasn't yet passed the exam), who is pulled out of his orderly life and into the circus world virtually overnight.  And suddenly, here he is, in a different world, a young and handsome 23 year old being used and abused by the men and women in this crazy circus sub-world.The story is told by Jacob at age 93 and now living in a rest-home.  Going between old Jacob with nurses clucking about trying to get him to behave, and then going back in time telling the circus story, reminds me of the old lady's perspective in the movie, \\\"The Titanic,\\\"  who is telling the story of young Jack and her life altering romance with him.  There's something about the technique that makes it all seem very real, like it's all in the present.Jacob's romance with one of the young, beautiful circus performers is a touching and believable tale.  The hucksterisms of his two bosses who run the circus, are also very realistic and an important part of the story.  I won't give too much away here, in case you haven't yet read the book, but an elephant named Rosie is also one of the main characters of the book who makes sure things turn out as they're supposed to.A very fun, touching and unique piece of american historical fiction.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Come and Join the Circus\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1192320000, \"reviewTime\": \"10 14, 2007\"}\n",

Other than that, reads beautifully, the images in between chapters appeared fine and crisp, dictionary functions well.Water for Elephants is one of those big, entertaining read that is packed with action and wonderful details, and, of course, a love story. From the first few pages there you get a clear sense that the story is just tailor made for the movies. The structure of the narration, the intricate period details as well as the classic twists and turn of the plot makes you feel like you are, quite literally, reading a movie. I could even hear faint soundtrack music in the background as I flipped through the pages!Jacob Jankowski, Ivy League vet science student, found himself on the road after his life is turned upside down by a freak accident. He made a fateful jump on a passing train, which turned out to a travelling circus. Soon after, he finds himself employed as the circus vet and falls head over heels for the star of the troupe, Marlena, who just happened to be the wife of the schizophrenic head of the menagerie. Then one day, an elephant joins the troupe and everything started to unravel.The love story itself is filled with cliches. Young man falls in love with a woman out of his reach, thinks his love in unrequited but can't help to yearn for her and therefore continues to woe her. And just when he thought his chances are gone, she confesses that the feeling's mutual. Aha, what about the evil, schizo husband? Well, they go through heaven and hell to escape him and that's basically it. The love story.And so it's not a surprise that the characters are not of great depth. Jacob is the naive, testosterone-bursting young fella who knows what or who he wants but doesn't have a clue how to get it. And is showered with luck and good friends to support him. Marlena, is the charming damsel in distress and her husband the wicked yet brilliant villain.But all those flaws, as great as they seem, are overridden by Gruen's superbly paced and gripping storytelling of a magical world of a bygone era. The world of the travelling circus in the 1930s she described just sucks you in. The lack of depth of the human character is replaced by the depth of character of their animal counterparts. Rex and Leo, the lions, Bobo the chimp and Rosie the Elephant. The story just came alive with all those great period details.Also, despite of the predictable outcome of the love story, it is the structure of the narration that keeps you glued until the last page. Gruen zooms back and forth between Jacob's old self, a miserable 93 yo in a nursing home, wifeless and seen as a mere duty to his family and his young self. The way old Jacob yearns for life is all too familiar and is echoed in the young Jacob's lust for life. Ultimately, you want to know what happens to both Jacobs: Will the young Jacob win his love, and will the old Jacob regains his peace of mind?Finally, this is not high literature.

I mean cmon!  It's a nearly 5 star book! Except that it never did.  Not even when it go the \\\"exciting\\\" part.One reviewer mentioned that it seemed as if the author realized they need to \\\"wrap it up\\\" and hustled the story along.  Where a day in the beginning took several pages, when it finally got to the \\\"good stuff\\\"...it was all done in a few paragraphs or very few pages.  It was an ok read at best, but it's not a 5 star book.  A 5 star book should be a book that consumes you and stays with you when it's over.  This book simply didn't do that.  It told a story, wrapped up and ended.It almost seemed like the author didn't really connect or have real grasp on the characters when writing the \\\"past\\\" parts.  When she wrote about elderly Jacob, it was spot on and you really felt what Jacob was feeling and got immersed into his world.  While when reading about young Jacob, you feel more like you are just reading a story about someone.  For me the best books are those that put you in the world of the character, and for whatever reason, Sara could only do this in the present storyline.Also, the ending of the present day Jacob was a little lackluster I thought, and completely unrealistic.  It kind of took away from what good the book had.Bottom line:  it's an ok read, but I can't say that I'll be going around recommending it to my friends or anyone who asks about it.COMPLAINT:  Before I reviewed this Kindle Book...it was $5.00.  When I bought it, the price had gone up to $6.39.  I noticed that the cover changed to the \\\"movie one\\\".  This seems RIDICULOUS since Kindle readers don't really have a use for covers.  Also, the original book has old time pictures of circus people.  The Kindle version does NOT have this, because the movie book doesn't have them either (I checked in a local store). Which makes sense in that you can't have a movie cover with pictures that don't relate to the movie so they were evidently removed.

When I read in Entertainment Weekly the Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison would be starring in the film adaptation of Water for Elephants, I knew that I had to pick it up. I rarely pay full price for a book. However, this one had such rave reviews that I couldn't help myself. Still, it sat on my bookcase until this week when I promised to read it before the opening of the movie. Honestly, I was greatly disappointed.Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski who is so distraught after his parents' deaths that he runs away with the circus. He leaves between his education at Cornell University and his future as a veterinarian. Fortunately, his study of veterinary medicine helps him land a job as the circus' vet. While touring with the circus he meets a number of characters from a red haired midget clown, to an old circus worker who is struck with \\\"jake walk\\\" (a condition brought on by drinking tainted whiskey). Jacob soon discovers that life on the road is beyond trying. When an elephant is brought on as part of the show, Jacob finds himself torn between his job as a compassionate vet and the rules of the circus. This causes Jacob to bump heads with his boss, August, who is beyond temperamental and at times masochistic. To complicate matters, Jacob is in love with the lead actress of the show, Malena, who just happens to be August's wife.While the subject matter of the circus would seem to be incredibly interesting, this novel was boring from start to finish. The entire plot was cliched, the relationships were shallow, and the characters were without depth. From the first chapter, I knew the exact path that the novel was going to take. Every time I thought to put the book down, I convinced myself to give it one more chance. It was after all a bestseller, therefore, I thought it would get better. It never did. If anything, it got worse as every cliche was reinforced. The only twist came at the very end and was so absurd I had to re-read the last few pages three times over to make sure that I read it correctly. A book is only as good as its character development but in this novel there is no development. Though Jacob attempts to mature, he can't seem to figure out what his priorities are. Incidentally, neither can Gruen for she has Jacob bemoan his conflicting emotions between his love for Marlena and his feelings towards animal abuse. Fortunately for Jacob, the animals take their fate into their own hands which relieves Jacob of having to develop. I hope, for the box office's sake, that the movie fails to resemble the book.

With creatures of every variety in need of his services, Jacob becomes part of the Benzini Brothers, a circus dying to be Ringling Brothers and as we learn, their management, headed up by Uncle Al, a brute in anyone's managerie is ready to literally dump dead weight and steal what he needs to drive that train where he wants it to go. Jacob endears himself as a necessary component and survives the late night \\\"redlighting\\\" that makes roadkill of certain colleagues.Love springs eternal as both young and old Jacob encounter women who make the journey worth hanging for. When the elephant comes to town, the men of both eras are drawn closer still and we can feel their joy, their pain, their passion writ in every color of the literary rainbow. Ms. Gruen clearly has a passion for the subject and has researched every nuance and trick of the period(s) and the ride is a rollick.

Their answer comes in the form of an elephant named Rosie, and a fateful disaster that destroys those holding them back, while free the lovers to their happily ever after.This story comes full circle in the end as 93 year old Jacob finds himself once again at the gates of the big top, and is given a chance to go home once again.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Transported to the Circus\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1295136000, \"reviewTime\": \"01 16, 2011\"}\n",

One, Jacob is a vet (sort of), which I love because that is what I want to do. You can obviously tell he loves animals. The characters were complex and intriguing. The bad guys like August and Uncle Al had so many levels to them that they were often hard to read. Rosie, the elephant, was probably one of my favorite characters.

For all Gruen's indepth research into circus life of the 1930s, the atmosphere of the narrative felt wrong. The dialogue sounded far too contemporary and the stage directions -- \\\"I looked out the window\\\"; \\\"He moved his jaw before answering\\\"; \\\"I looked steadily at her then looked away\\\"; and the dramatic \\\"in the distance I heard the sound of a camel\\\" -- were intrusive. Add to that the constant  cutting back and forth from young-buck Jacob to retirment-home Jacob and you feel not that you're immersed in another world, but rather reading the script of a touching Hallmark Theater production.The characters are from central casting: the good hearted whore, the tyrannical boss, the crazy husband and his sweet but long-suffering wife. And the noble hero. Young and bereft of family, Jacob stumbles into circus life and is hired as a vet. He is painted as the champion of the small and weak, regardless of sex or species, always wanting to do good and right. And yet, at the moment when his friends need him most, he's gone, taking their only means of protection, a knife, with him. And the elephant for whom he professes deep affection he leaves to the hands of a crazed maniac, to be beaten not once but twice, and our hero does nothing about it. How can we possibly cheer for him?Too bad the story wasn't told from the POV of a minor character named Greg. Greg shows up twice, first when he retrieves the elephant using what he knows she loves, booze. He shows up later ministering to her wounds from one of the beatings. He's speaking Polish to her, the language she understands. Why did we need Jacob?

I could not put it down once I began reading it. Perhaps it's because I'm rapidly approaching the age where I could end up in a nursing home myself, but that part of the book fascinated me. It's from the perspective of a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It rang true.  I was touched by the nurse who treated him like a person, who explained things to him, and cried with him when his family failed to show up to take him to the larger-than-life event he had looked forward to throughout the book--the circus.  It made me think back over the experiences with our own parents and wish I could go back and do things differently.The other part of the book, the flashbacks into this man's history were fast-paced and exciting.  I immediately sympathized when, as a young man, he lost his parents and found himself alone in the world, and understood his running away from it all. Maybe I question the believability of one or two points while he traveled with the circus, but not enough that it marred my enjoyment of the book.  I simply took it as an indication of how much things have changed in this country over time. What would not fly now might have at one time. It opened my eyes to how easy it is to become absorbed into any society (even the world of a traveling circus)  and how to survive, a person must abide by rules they might otherwise never consider.  The book showed the higher and baser aspects of human nature, all of which I found easily believable.  The world is filled with people who have differing stories and problems.  We don't all behave the same or believe the same, but we do conform to the ethics of our individual worlds--good or bad.  I believe the author demonstrated that  beautifully.I read some of the other reviews, and was saddened that some people couldn't see past  the imperfections and simply enjoy the different facets of the story.

It was one of two best books I've read in the past year.  In fact, it probably ranks as one of my favorite books of all time.  It was expertly, yet simply, written by Sara Gruen.  The novel tells the story from the perspective of Jacob Jankowski who currently resides in a nursing home.  The story alternates between Jacob's current living situation and the story of his past, how he once worked in a circus during the first part of the 20th century.  The impending visit of a traveling circus next door to the nursing home prompts him to remember the details of his circus life/experiences when he was a young man.Gruen's description of the nursing home, its residents, and its day-to-day activities was spot-on.  Having visited my grandparents on several occasions in their nursing home, I could easily visualize and relate to Jacob's experiences.  It really came to life.You can tell that a lot of research was also put into the circus recollections of Jacob Jankowski.  Gruen delves into circus life in the early 20th century when circuses traveled via train from town to town, and animal welfare and regulations were little more than an afterthought.  I found all of Jankowski's experiences intriguing and actually felt like I was experiencing them right along with him.  The characterizations felt realistic, too, and I could easily distinguish between the many different circus workers, and even some of the more prominent animals.It wasn't until halfway through the novel, though, that I realized how the nursing home is a metaphor for the circus.  Gruen makes subtle comparisons between the animals in the circus and the residents of nursing home.  They're both herded, fed, and prodded.  Jacob even says, \\\"I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person.\\\"  So true.  And sad.Now that I've read this fantastic book, I'm very eager to see the forthcoming movie adaptation.  I'd like to say that I'd love to see a sequel to this great tale; however, I think Jacob Jankowski's story has already been told in full in this one well-crafted novel.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Water for Elephants, Candy for Readers\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1300665600, \"reviewTime\": \"03 21, 2011\"}\n",

In many ways, I felt the same way reading Sara Gruen's fast-paced and engaging story. It is an oddity. It is wondrous. And it also has some plodding, filthy elements.\\\"Water for Elephants\\\" starts with a grippping prologue, during which we see the murder of a circus employee in the 1930s. The story then switches back and forth between young and old Jacob, a man who gets pulled into the circus life, discovers love, adventure, and trouble, and then reflects back on that as an old man. Gruen does a fine job creating this empathetic character, though the old man's story becomes less important and almost campy by the end. The young man's story delves deeply into circus life, with lots of interesting details and conflict, although the characters are all fairly black and white, with the villains being obvious and predictable. For some reason, Gruen also seems compelled to give us lurid details of the circus striptease and Jacob's own loss of virginity at the hands of the \\\"cooch tent\\\" prostitutes. Why these elements are described in such detail only detracts from the already shallow love story to come. It would be nice to see some intellectual dialogue between our male and female leads, rather than coy glances, \\\"shapely calves,\\\" and the surface attraction of teenage relationships.Soon, Jacob's background in veterinary studies allows him to find a place onboard the circus train, during which he falls in love with Marlena, a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. When the circus procures a new elephant for its act, it provides a link between Jacob and Marlena, as well as with Rosie the elephant. The problem is the jealous and psychotic August, Marlena's husband. We know he must be removed from the picture for this to work. Deeply ethical and moral issues come into play, but Gruen chooses the easy route and solves the problem in a somewhat satisfactory but highly implausible way. This is only underlined by the equally implausible solution of old-man Jacob's frustrations. Sure, it's all warm and gushy, but the deep research and texture of the circus and some of its elements give way to romanticized solutions that turn a historic novel into one of borderline fantasy.With all the fanfare over this novel and tie-in movie, I suspect I'll be accused of being the blind man here in my description of the \\\"elephant.\\\" Many elements were strong and well done, but much like Sebold's \\\"The Lovely Bones,\\\" all of the wonderful storybuilding gives way to a conclusion that feels a bit forced and too easy.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"A \\\"Blind Man's\\\" View\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1305676800, \"reviewTime\": \"05 18, 2011\"}\n",

The characters also represented each aspect of the circus; I became concerned for the stage dwarf as much as an old tent setter.

An old man, either 90 or 93 - he can't recall - lives in a desultory, grumpy funk in a generic nursing home, treated like a product, given impersonal but efficient care, and regularly visited by a vaguely attentive, dutifully loving, but clueless family. He is lonely; he misses his wife; he longs for attention from his prolific family, but understands that they have problems of their own. For solace, he relives his early life on a continuous thread - his life as a circus veterinarian for a second-rate travelling show.In alternating chapters, the author, Sara Gruen, takes us from the present to 1931 and back, showing us a rich history of a good young man whose life is changed forever when his parents die in a car crash, leaving him destitute just as he is to stand for his final exams at Cornell. He had hoped to go into practice with his father as a small-town vet; instead, at a total loss, he bolts, jumping a train which turns out to belong to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth (or words to that effect). He is plunged into the colourful, quirky world of the circus, with all its different intensities and personalities; at risk of being summarily thrown off the train, he is reprieved by Uncle Al, the owner/operator/ringleader of the circus when that gentleman learns that Jacob is - for all intents and purposes - a vet, something Uncle Al has coveted for a long time.Jacob falls easily into the life, loving working with the animals, learning to become one of the circus family, and finding an unlikely friend in the dwarf whose living space he shares. Along the way, and almost immediately, he also falls hopelessly in love with the wife of Uncle Al's right-hand man August. Marlena is the woman of the horses, directing her own act with 12 beautiful Arabians in the ring, and her grace and beauty completely captures Jacob. He must tread carefully; her husband, August, is borderline insane and insanely jealous.The old Jacob buries himself in these memories, frets over the static life of the nursing home, and learns to look for one particular nurse who seems to be the only person who really takes an interest in him. She counsels him gently; she brings him food that is just a little better than what he's been getting; and we get a glimpse, through his eyes, of the frustration of the elderly, trapped inside a body that won't cooperate anymore and surrounded by people who aren't interested in his bright former life.This was an absorbing, entertaining book, a complete joy. Well-written, well-researched, it opens a door on a world that most people never thought about and makes the different subjects into real people. It also made me feel empathy toward those in impersonal facilities, who live for a familiar, interested face, and who long to impart to us the lives they led. I could not put this book down.

Written from the point of view of the protagonist, Jacob Jankowski, we find out how he is thrust into the world of circuses after he experiences a life-changing tragedy in his family, the death of his parents in an accident. The book goes back and forth from the present, with Jacob being in an assisted-living home, to the past, where Jacob boards a train and then, after being almost booted off, begins his world of traveling circuses aboard the Benzini Bros. With nowhere to go, and nothing to do, he begins the circus life, meets several of the key characters, such as Walter, Camel, Marlena, August and \\\"Uncle Al.\\\" While Gruen's ability as a storyteller is there, I felt like the book was a letdown because of the direction it took with the main character.One substantial element to Jacob's personality is his connection and compassion for animals, but I felt like there were times when he isn't the strong leading character he could be, and that this compassion for animals is inconsistent. For instance, there is a point after becoming the Benzini Bros. personal veterinarian, he indicates that his protection for animals is unbending saying \\\"...and what my father would do--what my father would want me to do--is look after them, and I am filled with that absolute and unwavering conviction.\\\" Yet, there is at least one instance when Jacob has a chance to stop the villain August from abusing Rosie, the elephant, but fails to take any action, despite how ruthless he knows August to be. Odd, considering that he makes some rash decisions, but none that are of much consequence.It also seemed odd to not focus more on the circus itself, as it pertained to Jacob and many of the other characters. Why not focus more on the spectacle of the circus, the performers, the competition between the rival circuses, and the pageantry of the event?  The potential to do this seemed to be there, especially the way the 93 year old Jacob reflects on the sweet memories of being in the circus, telling many workers in the hospital about those wonderful days with teary-eyed conviction.  Instead Gruen uses much of the book's energy on the \\\"forced\\\" relationship and wooden love affair between Jacob and leading circus performer Marlena, August's wife. I mean, if you are going to write about the circus, and do the research on it, why not concentrate more attention on events that involve the history of the circus. There was a pronounced shift to the love affair between Jacob and Marlena, especially in the novel's second half, and much of the dialogue between the two seemed hokey and silly. It made the book come across as a romance disguised as a circus story.Still, it was an enjoyable and relatively quick read. Gruen's ability to detail scenery and hook the reader into a story is present from the beginning to end and her writing flows smoothly. This is the kind of book that has many redeeming qualities, and makes for a good topic of discussion.I just wish the book wouldn't have \\\"sold out\\\" on a silly love affair; the potential for much more was there.3 1/2 stars\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Engaging writing, but too much focus on love affair\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1198368000, \"reviewTime\": \"12 23, 2007\"}\n",

With the recent release of the movie, I decided to pull my copy on loan from my bookshelf and read it before venturing out to the theater to see the movie (or, more likely now, renting it).Water for Elephants is definitely different from the other fiction I normally read.  The book takes place after the Great Depression, and Gruen did a lot of research surrounding circuses during that time to influence her book.  Many of the chapters began with a picture from circus archives, which really added to the experience of reading the book.  I absolutely loved how the chapters alternated between the main character's experience in his early 20's as the circus veterinarian and as a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It really made me think about the stories of my own grandparents, who are nearing their 90's themselves.The diverse cast of characters in the circus also made the drama of circus life a fascinating read.  I had no idea of the caste system in circus life, the treatment of employees and animals alike, and how competitive circus troupes were during this challenging era in U.S. history.I have heard that the book is better than the movie.

I don't know why - I worked on circuses for nearly seven years, and if that isn't a fodder for conversation, I don't know what is.\\\"There is so much that happens in Water for Elephants, from the point where Jacob discovers his parents are dead and flunks his veterinary exam to the point he runs away to the circus (and unknowingly at that). Soon he discovers that the circus has so much to offer, and it's own perils as well. When he meets Marlena and begins developing feelings for her, he finds himself standing on thin ice with her husband August, and when things begin to turn sour it seems he's not the only one out to get him.\\\"I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.\\\"But there's another side to this story - the Mr. Jankowski who lives in the nursing home after the rest of his family seems to have forgotten about him. The man who doesn't quite remember how old he is. Who doesn't like the 'food' (if you can call it that). The man who still remembers his days at The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.The story was well crafted and encompassed all the different elements of life in the circus. Some actual photographs found at the beginning of each chapter added to the 'realness' of the plot and make the whole store seem even more realistic. Similarly, the characters were well developed, and the patriarchal hierarchy of circus performers vs. workmen was explored also. I loved to see how Marlena became a stronger character throughout the novel, eventually taking a definite stand against her mentally instable husband. And Jacob? Well, during the whole story he was there to learn the ropes and was always there to stand for what was right - for the animals he treated and the people he became friends with.*CONCLUSION*Overall, I really enjoyed Water for Elephants.

I love fun, breezy reads like many readers out there. I have read `em high and... low. There are times when I just want an escapist read. But given the perimeters--those reads usually deliver the goods. Though the stories may be a tad simple.Here we have a book that's been out a while. Supposedly one with some substance. So we have a guy who winds up joining the circus after ditching an Ivy league education in the Depression years.  I can go with it. No problem there. But then we have the host of characters in the circus itself. Some of this is good reading--but then--we have problems of cliched, predicatable writing wedged between sections of rather better-than-average writing. And all too many flat characters with little substance.Much of this appears in this story. That's the problem. Besides, Jacob is just not all that engaging to me or a convincing character. And the story comes off predictable and rather weak. So it's a passable beach read.Given the kind of over-the-top and unsubstantiated praise this novel has received, surely, I can't be the only one who feels this way and I can't help but notice than whenever there is a unfavorable review of this book  there will be an outpouring of five star reviews--one after another--that are all two or three sentences of praise and little real commentary.Coincidence?Again, not an altogether bad read, but this is no KITE RUNNER or actually, SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN, two far better reads than this.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Much ado about a so-so read\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1178841600, \"reviewTime\": \"05 11, 2007\"}\n",

Some deeply moving, others barely creating or leaving the slightest ripple in my conscious brain. Some, seemingly, with the power to change the way I see things or think about things...sometimes subtly, and in others there are major thought differences after finishing the book. This book has affected me deeply.The last book to touch me this way was some months back when I read \\\"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank\\\" by Thad CarhartThe Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelierwhich I heartily recommend to you.With \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" Sara Gruen creates the long-forgotten days of the Train Circus, and all that life entailed in those days...from the impossible \\\"set-ups\\\", \\\"knock-downs\\\", and in many cases \\\"hasty retreats\\\" from any particular chosen town before the authorities arrived upon the scene.\\\"Hard Luck Days\\\" certainly would be a fitting genre to place this awesome story into. And, of course, with the depression, etc., they truly were hard luck days, for everyone involved with the exception of perhaps Uncle Al with his penchant for stealing, skimming, using and abusing everyone on the show. We also come to know August and his sickness that continually creates misery and unhappiness both for him, and also for those closest to him. There is Marlena, August's wife and performing partner with her performing horses, and later her act with Rosie the Elephant (a charming, and all-knowing wonderful beast if ever there was one). There are dozens and dozens of other characters, distributed throughout all levels of the show, from performers right on down to the dung-shovelers and the guys who do nothing but put up and take down the tents for the big top, day in and day out endlessly, working like dogs for sometimes nothing. We meet the midget clown Kinko also known as Walter and are shown into his rather twisted life, and also we meet Camel, an unfortunate, for sure, addicted to and dying from Jamaican ginger paralysis, a common and cruel death from drinking bad alcohol. We meet and deal with the sadistic Blackie, and witness his ways with dealing with those \\\"done with\\\" on the traveling show.Sara Gruen has created a most wonderfully \\\"real\\\" environment and \\\"time\\\" for this story to inhabit, one that clearly allows one to \\\"see\\\", \\\"feel\\\", \\\"smell\\\" and \\\"witness\\\" at what seems \\\"first hand\\\" how life was for those who lived \\\"the Big Top life\\\"....a marvelous talent for a writer.

Luckily I received an advance copy from the Vine Program to read and review, and I will be starting it just as soon as I finish here with this review of \\\"Water for Elephants\\\".Sara Gruen....You may never read this, but I wish to Thank You, personally, for giving us this truly Lovely, Wonderfully Entertaining book.

Do yourselves a favor, like me, and take this excellent journey with this gifted author.  Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a very moving story about relationships and family.  When Jacob Jankowski loses his family, he actually joins the circus.  Not because he wanted to, but because it presented itself.  Fortuantely, Jacob was studying to become a veterinarian and the circus was full of animals.  The story is told from the perspective of Jacob as an elderly man and Jacob as a young man.The relationships that Jacob forms during this excellent novel form the corserstone of the story.  I found myself caring about a grouchy dwarf and his 3-legged dog, as well as an elephant, and a cast of numerous colorful characters.  The evocative descriptions of the circus itself - the Benzini Brothers; a wannabee Ringling Brothers - during the Depression; actually put you on a railcar with the smell of dust all around you.  This is certainly no glamorous lifestyle, and Gruen does an exceptional job of providing vivid imagery.  The menagerie that Jacob helps care for are an important piece of this wide ranging cast that features individuals that are easy to hate and aome that are easy to love.  Jacob meets Marlena, who is married to the evil August, and the relationships that ensue become increasingly complicated.I now know more about circuses that I ever knew I wanted to.  I am glad that I do, because the learning was all part of the great fun to be had here.  This is a very entertaining and compelling book.

So when \\\"Water For Elephants\\\" was loaned to me with a recommendation, I put off reading it. The movie, which I didn't see, got underwhelming reviews, which made me postpone it further. I think I read two new mysteries before finally picking up this book.And then was I surprised.  I loved it! It is imaginative and takes me into the wonderfully described world of a 1930's third-rate train (traveling) circus. If this world seems a little grungy, I remind myself that at the beginning of the 1930's, only 10% of rural homes had electricity for hot water heaters.  Animal rights?  Nonexistent. Workers' rights? Taking its first baby steps.  Occupational safety - don't make me laugh.  Bigotry?  How can fiction be worse than the truth. And over it all, the Great Depression, with it's unrelenting desperation.And these are illustrated in a heckofa story. The plot doesn't just advance, it gallops, it whoops. It has romance, but not implausible romance. Jacob Jankowski is the protagonist, telling the story, with a great last-minute twist, in flashbacks that I thought were handled well. As a matter of fact, the only part of the story that was too unrealistic for me was Jacob's rush to run away from all he knew - to literally, though unintentionally, run away to join the circus. And there he meets Marlena, a circus star with her trained horse team, and Augustus, her equal parts charismatic and brutal husband.I very much recommend this novel.

Good books do that do me. And this was a good book.Brilliant, actually.That's the best way to describe it. The words themselves, the characterization, the anticipation. It's brilliant.Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is the story of Jacob Jankowski at twenty-three and at ninety (or ninety-three). At twenty-three, he ran away and joined the circus after his parents were killed in an accident. He had been studying to be a vet and was all but final exams. In the circus, Jacob encounters brutality, unexpected kindness, and love. At ninety (or ninety-three), Jacob's in a nursing home.The story fits well with Resurrection with it's themes of dignity, redemption, and anticipation. Twenty-three-year-old Jacob's Resurrection scene spread the resurrection and transformation to others. The Jacob in the end of the book is different from the Jacob in the beginning, and his transformation allows him to step in and fight for others. He may not always succeed in the way he desires, but he hands resurrection to others. It's a story about coming home.It's a story about dignity. Gruen frames the story so that you are hit by the fact that this old man, left to drool over Jello his last few years, is the twenty-three-year-old Jacob in the circus. These stories aren't just stories. They're stories of people we've forgotten about. It made me remember sitting at tea with my grandmother listening to her stories. I wish I'd written them down.It's about the dignity of the outcasts. In Depression-era America, especially on a circus, midgets, drunks, and the bottom-of-the-barrell working class were the outcasts. They weren't \\\"needed\\\" in society. They were easily disposed of. Because of this, Jacob becomes a Christ-figure restoring the dignity of a midget and a drunk, fighting for the oppressed, both human and animal.Gruen's strongest point, I think, is her ability to build anticipation. One scene captures it: Grady has (bad) news for Jacob. In waiting for Grady to spill it, Jacob notices the two drops of grease leaking from Grady's hamburger. Brilliance in these little details. The reader (namely, me) wants to shake Grady by the shoulders and scream at him to tell already!It's also about what Gruen doesn't write, where she holds back. I think as writers, sometimes we think we have to fill in every detail. For example, in a fight scene, Gruen doesn't give a blow-by-blow. Rather, she focuses on the confusion of the protag (Jacob), his swirling thoughts, a moment of pain here or there, his inability to stop hitting. Rather than observing the fight as you would a movie, you're caught up in the hero.

The glory days of the circus. A time when a plethora of men out-of-work combined with a plethora of families looking for amusement and a modicum of freaks. Let's face it: throughout history, mankind has been sprinkled with a modicum of physical and mental freaks. Their ability to find job satisfaction fluctuates, but they're always out there.(Caveat: As a child in Wisconsin, I certainly attended a circus or two, and dutifully watched the now-defunct Great Circus Parade on TV, but have never visited the Circus World Museum in Baraboo. I am just as much an outsider as the rest of you, unless you are a Flying Wallenda, in which case I am a much bigger outsider.)The circus of Water for Elephants is the (name of circus), which is certainly a mouthful. To the eyes of this non-Flying Wallenda, it appears to be pretty typical of the time, especially once it gets an elephant. More on that later.II. PlotJust a brief synopsis here, since you have likely seen the film, read the book, or are planning to do so. Jacob Jankowski (protagonist), runs away to join the circus after his parents die in a car accident. Perhaps unwisely, he does so just before finishing his veterinary degree. He meets August, the bipolar head trainer. He falls in love with Marlena, August wife. After the circus picks up an elephant named Rosie, Jacob uses his profound understanding of animals (and the Polish language) to bond with her. And with Marlena. Since August is a total jackhole, though, this relationship is doomed.Luckily for everybody, the circus owner (Big Al) is known for cutting corners, and his spendthrift ways end in total calamity. The animals get loose, August is trampled to death, and Jacob sweeps Marlena off to live happily ever after. They have children, he works for a real circus (Ringling), and end up ditching the nursing home for yet another circus.III. CharactersI couldn't help but picture Robert Pattinson in my head as I read this book, and I hated that. Same for Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz. Nothing to be done, but I wish it had been left to my imagination.Though I found the premise a little unbelievable on the whole (literally running away to join the circus?), I did empathize with Jacob. Preparing for a profession that requires you to stick your hand up a cow's butt is hard enough. Once your parents are tragically killed? Forget about it.The Jacob/Marlena/August love triangle didn't convince me either, but perhaps that was residual cringing from Jacob's sexual awakening facilitated by the ladies of the cooch tent.(I should also apologize to the man sitting next to me on the bus that one day. Sir, if you happened to notice that I was reading about a man getting deflowered, I DO APOLOGIZE.)Honestly, the character I liked best was old Jacob. (No, my favorite was not the elephant. I did not cheer when she killed August, nor at the many times the reader was reminded that ELEPHANTS ARE PEOPLE TOO. Save it for Greenpeace.) Old Jacob, an imperfect narrator, combined the indignities of old age with a fierce desire to keep living. He doesn't remember how old he is, nor which of his many relatives was supposed to take him to the circus camped next to the nursing home. But he's feisty enough to scoot himself over when no one else will, and it's that same sort of self-determination that won us two world wars, darnit!*wipes tear from eye*Maybe I'm just nostalgic for the grandpa I never had. It's like that scene from The Royal Tenebaums, when Royal reads the gravestone of a man who died heroically on a sinking ship. The viewer is led to believe this is a relative of Royal's. He then says something like, \\\"What a man. I wish I knew him.\\\"Well, I wish I knew Jacob Jankowsky. After he finished all that silliness with the circus.IV. StyleGruen uses a framing device, in which the bulk of the book is recalled through the eyes of the now-aged main character. The parallel? Present-day Jacob is eagerly anticipating a trip to the circus, whereas past-day Jacob worked many years on a circus. I do love the framing device, confusing as it is when you start the book. (More or less than in medias res? Discuss.)I appreciate a single protagonist/point of view kept constant throughout the book. I would not have liked to read a chapter told by Marlena, or the elephant, or the dwarf. It's hard enough keeping these people (and animals) straight with just one narrator.The ending was a little tidy for my taste--I kept expecting Marlena to miscarry or die in childbirth. That their long and productive union disappointed me probably speaks more to my own predilection for dystopian fiction (where EVERYBODY dies) than Gruen's storytelling abilities.The pacing was good, and you definitely knew when the book climaxed. I appreciated the real-life archival circus photographs scattered throughout, as well as the small details of circus life: the cookhouse flag, the water buckets, the segregation of performers and labor. Who knew that 50,000 people were paralyzed after drinking Jamaica ginger extract? Not me, even after watching the entire first season of Boardwalk Empire. HBO fail.Conclusion:Water for Elephants is a \\\"slice of life\\\" novel. In this case, Depression-era circus life. My criticisms aside, it's a worthy read.

I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.

Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to \\\"run away\\\" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.

It's gripping and complex, with some wonderfully written supporting characters such as Walter, Camel, Uncle Al and Rosie the elephant. The tension slowly builds between the central characters, but is relieved with some laugh-out-loud moments from circus lore. The story is told in flashbacks from a 93 year old. There are some truly poignant moments at the nursing home.

I often write that most books need to be shorter. Novelists seem to always come up with a great opening. Better ones have great endings. Most fail in the middle.

That&#8217;s a terribly hard thing to do and she pulled it off wonderfully.With one glorious exception, however, the characterization fell flat for me. Did I care about the characters? Kinda. Did I care about the romance? No. What did touch me was the role of the older Jacob. How this young, female writer climbed into the head of a ninety plus year old man, I&#8217;ll never know but his thoughts and actions rang true. He was facing death but still facing life and his inner monologue caused an almost claustrophobic feeling in myself. My god, I kept thinking. This could very well be me - trapped in a body, aware that I&#8217;m losing my mind to age and, most frightening of all, without the ability to do a damned thing about it. I hope to elicit that kind of reaction in a reader one day.The parts of the novel confined to an old man doing nothing much more than sitting in a wheelchair will stick with me for a while.

The setting transitions between the wild memories of working as a veterinarian for a travelling circus, set in the 1930s, and the protagonist's present life in a home for the elderly, lonely and unappreciated.  Themes of the book include romance, good vs evil, depression era desperation, and life in old age.The main character is a well studied near-graduate from an Ivy league school who loses everything after a catastrophe and feels he must run away and happens upon a circus train. He ends up working in very rough conditions to survive, and struggles with a love triangle that puts his life in peril.My personal affection for the book lies in the brutal conditions desperate people will endure, particularly for those who feel they have no place to go, as some of these characters do.  I'm also very fond of the contrast of how the elderly protagonist struggles with trivial tasks, like wanting to eat a crisp apple, while his younger self survived through such turbulent times.  Finally, the layout of the story, in which some details are revealed out of order through the time-transitions, enables the reader to piece certain details together before the main narrative gets to it feels like a device out of the movie Pulp Fiction (in a good way).This novel is written based off of actual and anecdotal incidents of circus life (as per the interview with the author contained in the back of the book).  The historical basis, however, is unnecessary to appreciate the vivid story but definitely made me appreciate the author's research to include tidbits of American history that might otherwise be lost.

It seems to have been dashed off from a previously constructed outline, without any regard for building up characters and then modifying the plot if it made more sense for their motivations.

Almost overnight, he is employed in a circus, the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Animals love him and he loves animals, but not only. He falls in love for the very first time in his life. But love, just like wild animals, can be dangerous if one is not too careful, and it slowly dawns on him that all the glittery world of a circus is not always what it seems...The book is written in alternating chapters between present day and the past. The present day is represented touchingly, moving in a few parts, although the main character Jacob, now mostly sitting on a wheelchair with a few aches and pains, still has a sense of humour and a passion for life that is uplifting. He is now ninety.

I know a lot of people are interested in reading this book because of the recent Major Motion Picture starring Rob Pat and Reese Witherspoon.Oh, Well the premise of the story is quite interesting, an almost college graduate who runs away after his parents tragic death (nope this is not a spoiler it's in the back cover) only to join a traveling circus where he goes from a stable boy to the circus vet in a course of (well less than a year), and falls in love with a married showgirl named Marlena who is suffering under her abusive husband August (who is described as being schizophrenia but every psychologist will tell you he's just an aggressive, controlling jerk with anger management problems).So, this book has all the elements possible to make it a good read, Adventure, Romance, Drama, and forbidden love Blah Blah Blah !Adventure, Hardly ! Action (Well apart from the few scenes of hopping in and out of trains there's hardly any to count), Romance & Forbidden love ? (the romance element although seems to sum up a big part of the story even bigger than the circus is so contrived, lacking and unrealistic. The characters hardly hold a conversation to make us believe they belong together, I didn't care if Marlena and Jacob separated for life ! Actually I found myself hoping they would just to spice up the book from its predictable ultimate boring ending and I'm a person who loves happy endings) Circus Life ? Well, Yeah its there all right but the writing doesn't allow it to come to life. I never felt transported to the 193os, I never felt that I was in a circus. The descriptions were unfortunately very flat.The characters are the biggest disappointment in the book. They are two-dimensional at best as well as stereotypical. The Good guys are innocent, nice and bearing all the sufferings of the world on their shoulders and the bad guys are greedy jerks and a$$holes who only care about profit and the $$$ money !Some people were complaining about the Over the top sex scenes, Ahh, O.K ! I'm used to reading romance books heavy on sex scenes and this one doesn't even come close. I don't mind sex in books as long as there is a reason to it and as long as it is beautifully written. In here the characters are just flat out boring that they make sex and murder boring.Obviously none of them is sympathetic even Jacob who just lost his parents, we never get insight into his soul. We never knew for sure why or how was he driven by depression and shock after his parents death to leave all his life behind him and join a circus, we never even know how he recovered from the lost of his parents because he never show any signs of being sad or depressed. Marlena on the other hand, well she is in an abusive relationship so its O.K that she cheats on her husband with Jacob. It would've been rather interesting if her husband was actually a good man but she fell out of love with him and ran away with Jacob leaving the circus. Now that would've been a better conclusion !This book/author does the fatal mistake of telling instead of showing. We are told that this and that happens but we are never shown and therefore never transported. I give it 2 stars for entertainment value and because it was a fairly easy/fast paced book to read. However, other than that maybe I was expecting too much but this book is overhyped and frankly way overrated.\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"summary\": \"Overrated !\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1291334400, \"reviewTime\": \"12 3, 2010\"}\n",

Definitely nothing mind-blowing in terms of plot or prose but a very entertaining look at depression era circus life.The author alternates (for the most part) chapters between Jacob's life during the depression and his life as a 90 year old in a nursing home. One gets the sense that the author seeks to evoke some sympathy for the 90 year Jacob's plight. In this endeavor she fails as she never fully fleshes out his relationship with his children. Thus the reader is left feeling slightly apathetic as to his plight as a lonely and ornery old man wasting away in a assisted living facility.Finally, the ending is a bit contrived and convenient. The frail old Jacob making a break for it out of the retirement home and going to the circus event that is in town. There of course he meets and befriends one of the circus directors who spirits him away on their cross country tour.

So, I was quite surprised when I read how the book begins - with the murder of one of the main characters. When I further realized that August does not own the Benzini Brothers, I began to see the movie as its own story separate from the book.Jacob is by far the most interesting character of the book, especially since he tells the story as an old man in a nursing home - and has the wisdom and experience to go with his age. His emotions are infectious and I longed to sit down with him and listen to all of his stories in person way before I finished the book.August is the kind of villain that is confusing in his evil deeds - he has schizophrenia - which makes it somewhat unfair to dislike him so much. His irrational behavior has been exploited for the almighty dollar by Uncle Al - but the real villain tends to fade into the background.Marlena is beautiful to the point of angelic, very little of what she does can be considered wrong in any way, as she is a victim struggling for freedom for most of the book. She approaches August's mood swings with the same caution due a wild animal, and remains faithful to him despite her personal feelings, and does not leave until he first betrays her. Considering how women today will leave their husbands for any reason, I admire her strong morals.The background is set during the Great Depression, which made for many intense situations as the circus struggled to profit, as well as the survival of the cast of characters. Though I studied this period in American history, the direct experience gave me a clearer idea of the desperation of people alive during this time - how easily morals could be put on hold for the sake of another mouthful of food or another coin in the pocket. So many men of the circus would work without pay for the promise of another meal and unending hope that life could still improve.Rosie, the elephant, is also one of the most fascinating characters in the book. She proved to be only one example of how animals were exploited to the point of cruelty for profit. I could not help wondering where the animal activists were.Needless to say, this book sparked many conversations and inspired many moments of personal contemplation for me.

August is a bit off mentally to say the least.One of the most remarkable and memorable characters in the book is an elephant that the circus aquired named Rosie.

Because of this August beats Rosie on a regulart basis until Jacob by accident discovers that she only understands commands given to her in Polish.

August has more fits, ex circus employee's who were thrown off the train catch up, and performers get sick and tired of what has been happening.

I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book. Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here. The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider. We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains. Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and \\\"Uncle Al\\\", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page. For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish. I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well. Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater. He's simply too many things rolled into one. Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable. And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic. Perhaps if she'd actually used the \\\"show, don't tell\\\" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional. As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man. One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do. Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook. It's hard to respect a character like that. Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram. In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action. I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story. Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book 4 stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man. I also really got a kick out of the ending. But on the whole, I would recommend this as a library book or a used book store book -- definitely NOT one you pay full price for.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"A beautiful song with some off notes\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1302998400, \"reviewTime\": \"04 17, 2011\"}\n",

They ring true, and have a poignancy regarding the lives and treatment of the elderly that stirs some guilty discomfort.  Leaving aside the over-the-top, sappy, happy Hollywood ending, these sequences are satisfying and believable.The larger narrative, that of Jacob in his twenties, also has an air of authenticity, at least in terms of feeling (to an outsider) like a dingy, dangerous, depression-era circus.  It is successful at creating a strong sense of the world.  But I never found myself getting wrapped up in the stories of any of the individual characters.  In other words, I just didn't get pulled in.Some people probably take offense at the blatant sexuality of a handful of scenes, and at the mistreatment of animals in several more.  I am not personally bothered by these, as they are pertinent to the story, but neither do they stir me to care much about the outcome of the story.  In the end, it was an easy read with a vivid world, but lacking (for me) much character-driven interest.  So I'm on the fence about whether I like it or not.

If you answered \\\"yes,\\\" then this book is for you. If you answered \\\"no\\\" then this book is for you too. There is something for everyone in this tremendously well-researched novel of schizophrenic madmen, a possible murderer in pink sequins and a towering heroine who happens to be addicted to lemonade. What could be more fun?A depression-era circus can be the best place to be if you're Jacob Jankowski and you just buried your parents, found out they mortgaged everything they owned to send you off to veterinary college and ultimately you had nothing left to lose.Some of the central themes of this page-turner are to follow your instincts, stay true to what you believe in and try to survive no matter what. It's the what part that kept me flying through the book. The story shifts back and forth from Jacob at ninety (or ninety-three--he's not sure) to his incredible life on the train with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth--the circus! By incredible, I mean that there is a constant fear-factor woven underneath every nuance, every situation is rubbed raw in not ever being entirely sure of just what the future holds, or even if Jacob has one. That dread is dolled out in buckets-full by the head honcho of Benzini Brothers--Uncle Al--who can have you \\\"red-lighted\\\" (tossed off the train) for any number of indiscretions, or simply to lesson the load. The incredible part is that, in the end, Jacob not only manages to become the circus veterinarian, he also gets the girl, a bereaved dog, one elephant (Rosie) and eleven horses. Who could ask for more, you ask? Jacob Jankowski, that's who.Then there are the animals. A team of \\\"Liberty\\\" horses, lions and zebras and llamas, giraffes, chimps, panthers, and Rosie--the elephant--the Polish elephant no less. The elephant that, like all elephants, drinks far more water than anyone could ever imagine carrying, which is one of many parables in this fast-paced tale.Did I mention the train? Benzini Brothers traveled exclusively by steam-train. The train becomes a powerful force that literally grabs up entire, failing circuses in its path and absorbs them like the little fish being eaten by the bigger one.Think shark.Uncle Al is a \\\"take no prisoners\\\" kind of fellow, unless he can get you for a song. Then he owns your soul.The secondary story line, that of old Jacob looking back on his days with the circus, added a depth to this novel rarely seen in most modern literature. He may not know his exact age, but there is a spark of life in him not quite ready to waste away in the nursing home that has become his prison. Then a circus comes to town and begins to set up shop right next door to the nursing home. It's an opportunity that Jacob simply can't resist.You won't believe what happens next...\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Oh My Gosh---Finally---A Happy Ending/Begining...\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1281657600, \"reviewTime\": \"08 13, 2010\"}\n",

Conrad Guest\\\"\", \"helpful\": [2, 3], \"reviewText\": \"An interesting premise, Water for Elephants: a melodrama that takes place in a traveling circus during the first half of the last century. Throw in forbidden love, an abusive husband, murder, and a few other plot twists, and you're assured a best-seller followed by a Hollywood movie with a topnotch cast.I went to the circus as a boy; I never wanted to run away with it, but I enjoyed it; then again, I never feared clowns.I've had Water for Elephants on my reading list for more than a year; it was highly recommended to me but it just kept getting pushed down on my reading list. Finally, with the movie due out, I opted to make reading it a priority.I won't say I didn't enjoy it, but I can't say either that it's deserving of all the accolades it's received. Author Sara Gruen obviously had a passion for the circus, as evidenced by the research that went into this piece and the period.Normally I enjoy melodramas--Victor Hugo's Laughing Man comes to mind. But Elephants, for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, just missed.Maybe it's just me. Some call Romeo and Juliet the greatest love story ever written. I happen to think it's the most overrated piece of literature ever penned. I mean, come on, Romeo falls instantly in love with Juliet the first time he ever lays eyes on her, and only after they part does he realize he forgot to ask her for her name. Can true love be founded on such a shallow premise? No, he's just reacting to hormones. It's young love, which is not really love at all, merely lust.At first I thought it was because Ms. Gruen wrote the piece from the perspective of a male protagonist, and like a lot of cross-gender writing, it somehow lacks a certain authenticity. But Jacob is a likeable enough young man, flawed; recently orphaned, he joins the circus to what we in the 21st century would say, \\\"Find himself.\\\" He certainly is attracted to Marlena, initially, for all the reasons a 20-year-old young man would be: she looks great in her pink sequined riding costume.But it wears old after a while--we want to see a relationship grow between them. What the story reveals is that Marlena, married, suffers from Battered Woman Syndrome. Her husband is mentally unbalanced and jealous to the point of insanity. He accuses her of infidelity with Jacob even though nothing has happened--except in their own mercenary hearts.Well, we were ready to impeach Jimmy Carter for admitting he'd lusted after women in his heart. Even the bible teaches that if your thoughts are impure, if you're unfaithful in your mind, you're just as guilty as if you'd committed the act. But nothing has happened between these two innocents except a shared kiss. But because her husband is such a beast we accept that it is okay and feel sympathetic toward Marlena since she is committed to make it work with her unbalanced husband because her parents previously told her, when she wanted to come home after admitting to them the marriage had been a mistake, that she had to lie in the bed she'd made.Yet I found neither Jacob nor Marlena very sympathetic; neither character was very memorable, even if the writing was sharp, crisp and authentic to the period. My sympathies lay with Rosie, the poor elephant who suffered such abuse at the hands of Marlena's husband she, the elephant that is, eventually killed him.Now that I've had more than a week to think about Elephants, to capture what seems to be an elusive reason for my indifference to this book, it occurs to me that a lot of books these days are written in this fashion, they expect the reader to connect with the character in their own way.I understand what that means and I don't disagree with it--until it's taken to an extreme and I'm presented with cardboard characters, caricatures.I want to connect with characters, not become them. I want to see how others respond to adversity. I can always later compare what I would've done, how I would've thought, were I in those circumstances.I guess, in the end, that's what was missing for me in Elephants: I just couldn't connect with Jacob or Marlena.Or, maybe at my age I just don't get young love anymore.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Nice Scope; Characters Fall Flat\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1304899200, \"reviewTime\": \"05 9, 2011\"}\n",

He ends up picking up some work with a traveling circus and his life takes a turn that he never anticipated.  He becomes a part of the circus family (as dysfunctional as can be..........but they put the fun in dysFUNctional!)Jacob recalls his life, while he is over 90 years old and relegated to a nursing home. A nurse mentions that the circus is in town and everyone will have the opportunity to attend a show. As he sits at a dinner table with several other elderly folks, one man looking to gain attention from the women makes the claim that he \\\"..used to carry the water for the elephants.\\\"  Jacob calls him a liar, because Jacob knows the amount of water that an elephant consumes, and those vast quantities could not be carried by one man.  When a nurse asks if Jacob worked in a circus he does not answer her, and that is when his memories are brought to life.  As he waits for his outing, the days pass and he relives the last 70+ years of his life in his mind.  The stories that are told about how the circus works, the value that is placed on the money coming in, the care or lack there of, for the animals, the living conditions on the trains for the circus workers...........all these things and more come alive in Jacob's tale.While it seems that the story starts a bit hesitantly, soon the reader is caught up in the tale, what happens to the different people, the relationship between the \\\"stars\\\" and the workers, many aspects of a traveling circus are revealed, even in the treatment of the animals!This story is an interesting portrayal of life in a traveling circus, and the ending is an unexpected one that takes you unaware.This is Sara Gruen's first novel and she is nominated for two Quill writing awards.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Circus life revealed through the memories of Jacob\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1161820800, \"reviewTime\": \"10 26, 2006\"}\n",

I kept hearing great things about it, but I just had no interest in reading about a circus. Then I saw the movie preview... and knew I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie (I'm rarely able to finish a book if I see the movie first). So I started reading, and had a hard time getting into it at first... I think this was mainly because I felt like I HAD to read the book... as if I was back in school!

In this case, I felt I had to give this book 5 stars based on the fantastic writing and the amazingly rich and unique backdrop of the train circus! It is obvious that the author did her research on circus culture and depression-era American history. She really dug into the down and dirty details of circus life. In the discussion after the last chapter you learn that many things in the story are based on true stories or anecdotes of the circus. The Bezini Brothers train circus is easily like another character in the book, flawed and deeply layered, like the characters themselves. I really liked how the story is told from Jacob's perspective as a spunky 93 year old man, having flashbacks of his life 70 year earlier. The altering perspectives (from young to old) effectively grounded the story and added another layer to his character.At times, this wasn't easy to read... It was sad to read about the indignities of being old, and I felt like Gruen's depiction was honest and very real. Though most of all, I had a really hard time reading some of the scenes with the animals. At one point I caught myself reading between my fingers, as if I was trying to block the scene from view as if it was a movie. I tried skipping over one but I had to go back and read it because I felt like it was important to the development of the characters and the story. It was, and they were.

I loved the way the author juxtaposes the young Jacob with the older Jacob; such a method has the potential to be jerky or awkward, but the transitions are smooth and the reader can easily manage to keep up with both storylines.Gruen is a skilled storyteller, I was caught from the first page and couldn't put the book down.  I love when a book does that, and makes me both happy and sad, and this book does both of these things at various points.  The most emotional aspect of the book for me was how Jacob felt about being in a nursing home, his frustration at having a \\\"young\\\" mind in an older body, and being treated as though he's senile by the nursing home staff as well as his own family.

I was not disappointed.  This is the story of a man who is looking back on his life and how his actions helped him become the man he became.  After the death of his parents he jumps a freight train only to discover it is a circus train.  He was one exam away from becoming a veterinarian at the time of his families death and his time with the circus not only helped form his view of the world but also his view of mankind and himself.  It was moving, the characters were 3 dimensional and grew during the telling of this tale.  I couldn't put it down.  The ending was very unexpected and I found myself wondering when it was all said and done what happened next.  Although this was not in a genre I normally read I would highly recommend it.  I am an animal lover and his compassion for the beast that were used by the circus was very touching.  I found myself routing for the good guys and hating the bad guys and thinking to myself  I could so see myself doing that.  There are things that happen in everyone's life that shape them, change them and help them become the people they are meant to be.

He's not really sure.\\\"When you're five, you know your age down to the month. Even in your twenties you know how old you are. I'm twenty-three, you say, or maybe twenty-seven. But then in your thirties something strange starts to happen. It's a mere hiccup at first, an instant of hesitation. How old are you? Oh, I'm--you start confidently, but then you stop. You were going to say thirty-three, but you're not. You're thirty-five. And then you're bothered, because you wonder if this is the beginning of the end. It is, of course, but it's decades before you admit it.\\\"Jacob lives in a nursing home--a bit of a grumpy old man but he does OK overall. He likes to give the nurses a hard time every so often. He resents having to eat Jell-O and the other soft food they try to pass off in the dining room. But his mind is drifting a bit; sometimes he finds himself in vivid dreams--and wakes to find himself unsure of where he is and why he is there. And when a circus sets up shop near the nursing home, Jacob's mind begins to wander more--back to when he was a young man of twenty-three. Back when he knew exactly how old he was. Back when his life lay before him like a blank canvas.He was studying to be a veterinarian. Unbeknownst to Jacob, his parents had mortgaged themselves to the hilt to put him through vet school. The idea was for Jacob to return home and join his father in the family practice--E. Janokowski and Son, Doctors of Veterinary Medicine. But on the brink of graduation, Jacob is called out of class. His parents have been killed in a car accident.  He's alone in the world. He returns home to bury his parents and finds that his legacy--the vet practice--is gone. It is the Great Depression and like others, his parents had fallen on hard times and there is nothing left--the bank claims it all.Although Jacob returns to school to sit for his final exam, he walks out without completing it, follows a road down to the train tracks, and hops onto a passing train--a n action that changes everything. For this isn't an ordinary train--it is the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob has landed on a circus train.A less profitable and more shady circus than Ringling, the Benzini Brothers circus is its own society--populated by two basic social castes: the Performers and the Working Men. They live their lives on the circus train--crisscrossing the country and setting up in various small towns around America. With his veterinary background, Jacob soon finds himself in charge of the menagerie--the collection of animals that perform in the circus. From horses to tigers to monkeys, Jacob cares for the animals with compassion and concern--doing the best he can in difficult circumstances. (After all, when even the men don't get paid some days, there isn't much money for animal food.)He is befriended by a married couple who perform in the circus. Marlena is the beautiful star who performs with the Liberty Horses. August--Marlena's tempermental husband--is the equestrian director and superintendent of animals (in other words, Jacob's boss). Jacob is instantly smitten with Marlena but works hard to conceal his feelings--August has a dark temper that can flare unexpectedly. At first Jacob can control his attraction, but when the circus takes on Rosie--an elephant--things become complicated.The fates of Jacob, Rosie, Marlena and August become forever intertwined--linked together by love, hate, jealousy and violence. How this story plays out forms the core of the book--taking a path that is full of twists, turns and surprises.My ThoughtsSara Gruen does a brilliant job of creating a world that I've never read about before--the world of a traveling circus train in Depression-era America. What a colorful and fascinating setting this was. Gruen does a wonderful job of giving you the feel for a life of a circus worker, and the story is enhanced by the black-and-white photos of actual circus performers from the era. You feel like you're looking at photos of the actual characters that populate the book. In the Author's Note and the accompanying interview, Ms. Gruen talks about her inspiration and research for the book. There are a million little details that give this book such an authentic feel. She really did her homework and it shows. From the words used by the characters to the descriptions of the logistics of the circus to the types of men and women who made their home in what was essentially a traveling, self-contained community, I felt like I was really there on the circus train.Although the heart of the book is what happens to Jacob when he joins the circus, the book alternates between the elderly Jacob in the nursing home and young Jacob in the circus. I thought this juxtasposition worked well (except for the very end--I personally didn't care for the final choice that Gruen made for the elderly Jacob). When the circus comes to town and triggers Jacob's memories, his story unfolds in a natural way--with the reader getting more and more drawn in to Jacob's story as it unfolds in the book and in his memories.In addition, Gruen establishes a framing device in the prologue that influences the reader from the very start of the novel. I found this particular choice extremely effective--and I loved how she pulled it off and tied it together at the end. I love when an author plays with her readers a little bit, and Gruen did a great job in this aspect.If you're looking for a movie to go with the book, I must recommend Dumbo. I kept picturing scenes from that movie as I read the book, and I could completely imagine this story being told in a similar way.My Final RecommendationI definitely see why this book was a bestseller. It offers something for everyone--a unique setting, a bit of history, a romantic triangle, animals, an examination in what it means to grow old. This book effortlessly fits all of this in without seeming forced or strained. And on top of that, it is just a good story that makes you want to find out what happens next. If you haven't read it already, I think it is definitely worth a read. If I was attending the Benzini Brothers circus, I would be standing up and yelling \\\"Encore!

The chapters then alternate between old Jacob and his very depressed state at the Assisted Living Facility and him remembering his journey with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. The circumstances on how he came to join the circus as the show Veterinarian were very sad. He went from being a young man about to graduate from Cornell, his whole future ahead of him and the possibility of FINALLY losing his virginity, to having no one and nowhere to go.Once on the show, he meets August, the show's equestrian director and superintendent of animals. August is one very questionable character. He can be the most charming man around and moments later he can turn into the most terrifying creature you've ever encountered. He also meets Marlena, August's wife, and falls in love with her on the spot. At a later point, the show aquires an elephant named Rosie who is thought to be stupid because she won't learn to do anything the trainers try to make her do. Rosie plays a huge part in this story, and she gave me the biggest surprise in this book. This story also takes you on an eye opening journey through the sad conditions circus employees and animals were under in 1931.Water for Elephants was a completely different read for me. It was Adult, and it was realistic, and I loved it. I was a little skeptical about the circus theme. Can't say I've ever been curious enough about its workings to read a book revolving around one, but I am so glad I did because it was sooo much more than that! It made me laugh, cry and gasp in astonishment sometimes. It was a huge plus knowing this will be a movie (coming out in April) starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon as the main characters.

The animals are mistreated, the workers are mistreated, and the \\\"ring leader\\\" Uncle Al, is an egotistical, greedy SOB that you will love to hate. The things that Jacob witnesses are truly appalling.The research that Gruen did in preparation for this story was definitely the most interesting aspect of the book.

Gruen paints a marvelous, completely believable portrait of a circus of the thirties, where the ruthless Uncle Al rules with the power of life and death. He deviates from planned appearances only to pick up the pieces of other failed circuses. Once someone ceases to be of use to the show, or if the money doesn't roll in as planned, they're gone--sometimes forever. It's a harsh world, but apparently historically accurate. And the old black and white photos at the beginning of each chapter are fascinating! Gruen's meticulous research makes the book--the plot line is a bit predictable and the ending a fantasy.

That said; there are a few short comings, some minor, some more substantial.The research about depression era circus' (not that I profess to be an expert) is excellent and makes a fascinating backdrop to the story.  While the author makes great use of her research, the tone of the novel, particularly the dialogue, is too contemporary to sound authentic.  While this is a fault to some extent, it isn't one that will bother most readers.  In fact, it makes the novel more readable,likely contributing to it's success.  Fans of Faulkner and Steinbeck, of course, may beg to differ.I'm not sure why the author chose to make the novel's principal villain Jewish and allegedly Paranoid Schizophrenic.  The fact that he is Jewish is irrelevant to the plot (aside from the fact that it apparently makes his wife's family more likely to disown her) and his behaviour, while deplorable at times, isn't consistent with Schizophrenia at all.  These may seem like minor points, but they bothered me a little because they play into stereo types and were completely unnecessary.The romance that develops between Jacob and Marlena is predictable and uninspired.  The murder during the stampede is a little too contrived and highly improbable, and the final chapter is a little too sentimental for my tastes.  But despite these grievances, I was won over.The first half of the novel is definitely stronger than the second half.  Gruen's writing style is accessible, entertaining, and often very funny.  Jacob as an old man is cantankerous and vulnerable, and his frustration with growing old is truly heartbreaking.  These `present day' chapters are arguably the strongest in the novel.  While the love story is admittedly unremarkable, it was fascinating to read about life in the circus.  Greun weaves a series of amusing and presumably real (at least according to circus lore) anacdotes into the story.All in all, it isn't hard to see why this novel is a bestseller.  True, the love story is a little flat, but overall, the novel is hard not to like.  Water for Elephants isn't a literary masterpiece, but it's enormously entertaining.

Persky\", \"helpful\": [0, 0], \"reviewText\": \"Here is a delicious journey back to a gritty bygone era of big tops, roustabouts, circus trains, freak shows, midways.  Many of the extraordinary incidents in this novel, according to the author's notes, are rooted in oral history or based on anecdotes or actual written reports of those early 20th century years.  Those who rode the circus rails, many being family castaways and society's rejects, found family and home in that unique traveling milieu of humanity and managerie, and, in the process, grew tough in body and spirit.  BUT, even if you don't give a hoot about circuses or circus people, don't be put off by the title or theme.  (Although, is there really anyone in their 30s plus years who did not, as a child, sit and watch wide-eyed, delighting in the cheap glitz, the pulsating music, the flamboyant and rhinestone-studded costumes and, yes, the size and smell of the elephants, when the circus came to town?) This story is nostalgic in its telling, engaging in its characters, with a plot that clearly aligns the good guys against the bad.  There are wonderful descriptions of authentic circus activity, on-site intrigue, and a romance that you will really care about.  All of this, tucked into the ruminations of a contentious 90-year-old \\\"assisted-living\\\" resident whom you will also really care about.I suspect, however, one would have to have a soft spot for animals to want to open this novel and then to inhale it, as I did, in just a day and a half.

Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a \\\"90 or 93 year old man\\\" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works.

Honestly, after hearing some very good reviews about this books (actually, the reviews came to me via a co-worker who pressed a hand to her stomach, frowned and said, \\\"my daughter and I loved this book\\\") I figured I would give it a try.The first sign that this was not going to wind up on my favorite book list was that after an hour or so of reading, I realized that I was more than 100 pages in. Normally when I'm reading, I pause occasionally to think, reflect, sympathize, emphasize, synthesize, etc, etc, etc. But alas, nothing deep and worthy of reflection was to be found. Nothing to stop me reading for a moment to think about what I'd just read. Not that I was expecting much, but I find myself more appreciative of a book, story, news article, movie or television show if it can make me think about at least something more than the words in front of my face. Again, not here. There was nothing to be found.Eventually, as the story continued and I learned more about Jacob and the circus, I can't say I was surprised when I found myself not caring one way or the other what was going to happen to him, or the rest of the circus bunch - there was nothing for me to connect myself to these characters with. If anything, the more I read, the more impressed I became with the author's ability to keep me so detached!In addition to the weak and utterly predictable story, (I mean, who didn't see that August was either bi-polar or a schizophrenic, that Marlena was going to get pregnant, or that Jacob's family wasn't going to show?), the dialogue comes out incredibly thin - to the point that I'm actually thinking that the author has never heard two people speak to one another. The dialogue comes across as forced and, for lack of a better term, soap opera-ish. I half expected to hear the dramatic soap opera bumper at the end of each chapter \\\"will Jacob get the girl, will August find out about their illicit love affair and will Rosie finally learn English? Tune in next chapter..\\\"But I digress. For everything I've stacked in the negative column about this book, there is one redeeming quality - and that is the story. I'm (somewhat) not ashamed to admit that I literally couldn't put this book down. It was like literary candy on a rainy day (actually a smoky day here in So-Cal). I picked up the book at 8am and set it down again around 10pm (having stopped for food, news updates, etc). Needless to say, I was disappointed.Overall, a good book for when you require some mindless entertainment - like sitting in an airport, or on death row.Finally, I was not impressed with the authors use of 'authentic circus lingo.'

Second, Ms Gruen is writing the story from a male perspective, but she needs a little more practice.  Jacob seemed like a mama's boy, but I don't think that was her intention, instead it was her inability to really connect to her male character.Despite these minor flaws I found the story engrossing and from my male perspective I didn't think it ever got into 'romance novel' territory.  So guys, it's safe to read.  The trains, boozin' and rough living of a traveling circus in 1931 was very interesting.

After the teaser of a prologue, during which a murder takes place, the story shifts to real-time in the life of ninety or ninety-three year old nursing home resident Jacob Jakowski, as he realizes that a circus has rolled up mere blocks away. He is resigned to suffering through several standard days of monotony - wakefulness alternating with bouts of night-time and inadvertent, memory-filled dozing as he anticipates viewing the upcoming circus performance. Although his brain founders, his wit and wisdom-filled thoughts and words are spot on: of memory \\\"You start to forget words: they're on the tip of your tongue, but instead of eventually dislodging, they stay there,\\\" forced to take an antidepressant, \\\"You want to drug me. You want to turn me into a Jell-O eating sheep,\\\" on nursing home life, \\\"I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person,\\\" and after explaining his inability to keep track of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, \\\"My brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges.\\\" The story of his circus-related escapades is equally good.

But let me tell you that it certainly did.I was a little apprehensive about how it started, with Jacob in his golden years reflecting on his youth, but in the end I found this was actually one of the things I enjoyed about how the book was written.  Like Jacob, I longed for the times when his mind slipped back to his younger years when his body was whole and his mind sharp, when his passions ran high and his life was full of adventure.  I could relate to his frustration with his age, mental status and physically limitations.The story of his life was emotional, and felt very real.  The ending was surprisingly satisfying for the reader and Jacob, possibly because Jacob received what we all hope for at the end of a long life.

I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book.  Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here.  The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider.  We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains.  Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and \\\"Uncle Al\\\", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page.  For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish.  I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater.  He's simply too many things rolled into one.  Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable.  And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic.  Perhaps if she'd actually used the \\\"show, don't tell\\\" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional.  As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man.  One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do.  Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook.  It's hard to respect a character like that.  Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram.  In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action.  I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where  a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story.  Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book three stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man.  I also really got a kick out of the ending.  But on the whole, I would recommend this as a library book or a used book store book -- definitely NOT one you pay full price for.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Well researched but lacking\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1187049600, \"reviewTime\": \"08 14, 2007\"}\n",

I was expecting to be \\\"moved\\\"--as so many reviewers had indicated. Instead, I was only \\\"moved\\\" to flip the pages as quickly as possible to at least come to the surprise ending that was indicated in some reviews.The premise, the whole idea of a story set in a circus backdrop during the Depression, was fantastic. The story itself, in my opinion, failed. It failed for several reasons. The characters appeared to be no more than pawns for moving the story forward--they never made it beyond the cardboard cliche stage. Even Jacob, whose latter years were more endearing to read, was always seen from afar. We never really got in his head at all. He was totally unbelievable. Kid drops out of vet school and joins the circus and acts like a thirteen year old with thirteen year old dialogue.Which brings me to the dialogue in this book. Horrible! I caught myself laughing out loud, in disbelief at the cheezy sentences. And at one point I thought if I read \\\"uh\\\" or \\\"um\\\" one more time I was going to scream and toss the book in the trash.All that aside, if it was meant to be just a gaudy quick genre-type read, then it wasn't marketed that way. No one ever rose above the surface level, and I simply didn't buy it--the narrator, the girl, the speech during that era.The ending, well, it was okay. It meshed with the rest of the book.And Jacob, he seemed terribly stupid and sophomoric to be a lifetime vet who'd attended Cornell, etc. He was also grouchy and not likable, except when he finally got real about himself growing old. In fact, I came across this passage in ch. 16, \\\"...my brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges...\\\" I thought YES!! This is what the story is really about: a man who once had keen senses and awareness, and traveled with a circus of all things, has come to the end of the \\\"show\\\" and he is facing it and fearing it simultaneously.

At times the plot ran so quickly I found myself trying to search for a way to slow down the course of the story, but to no avail. The quick pace, however, does seem to fit and reaches a broader audience that seems to want rapid conclusion and catharsis. Reversions to the present time are a nice break from circus life and I believe are Gruen's most vivid and compelling depictions of the novel. Her illustration of life at the nursing home and perspective of the `patients' which Jacob catches a nurse stating when the correct political term is `residents' provides an accurate and refreshing look at assisted elderly homes. The circus lifestyle is portrayed truthfully, but is often overshadowed by the dynamics and major plot-line concerned with the Romantic relationship and triangle of Jacob, August, and Marlena.Gruen's, \\\"Water for Elephants\\\", is an easy read with relatively simple themes and motifs to comprehend including: animal cruelty, abusive relationships, circus life in the 30's, life during the Great Depression, coming of age, and older age/aging.

Some were illuminating, some were disturbing, some made me think about some of my most deeply held beliefs.  All in all - I am very glad I read these books, but as I started into \\\"Water for Elephants\\\", I realized that it had been quite a while since I read a book mainly to find out what happens at the end.My dad recommended this book - and I'm glad he did.  It's a wonderful story.  We experience, along with the main character Jacob, two parts of his life.  We travel through the Great Depression with him after he runs away and joins the circus (!) and we also see his current life as a patient/resident of an assisted living center.  Both times of his life were interesting to me.  I know next to nothing about circuses - yet I could almost smell the sawdust and hear the music as I made my way through this tale.Gruen has filled her story with the colorful characters one would expect from a circus troupe.  Beautiful acrobats, tortured clowns, animals with personalities almost as big as their trainers (and sometimes bigger!).  The details are excellently woven in, letting the reader see just enough without blocking one's imagination.  As the story builds towards the climax - I found myself doubting the ending I had been sure would take place.  Gruen creates just enough tension and suspense to keep the reader turning the pages at a brisk pace.I enjoyed, too, the scenes of Jacob in the present day.  All circus aspects aside, the book has some excellent insight into a man who feels as if he has outlived his life...without becoming a man who was finished with living.  His fears of losing his memories and mind, the despair he feels at the sameness of each day, and the appreciation he has for the few delights left in his day to day existence are beautifully crafted.  He may come across as a crotchety old man at times, but the reader, and a few characters whose eyes still see a man instead of an old man, know that not to be true.\\\"Water for Elephants\\\" was a very enjoyable story.  It was an interesting and fun book - well researched and well-written.

I always like to warn people just in case, but in this situation I really don't think it's necessary, becuase the very first chapter sort of ruins the polt anyways.

This did grab my attention and get me into the book.  But as I went along, I realized,  I think they gave away all the good stuff in the first couple pages!  I would much rather have not known that this incident was going to happen so early on!  Because really, this is the major turning point of the book.  THE event the whole story is leading up to.  So, really, there are no real surprises here.However, with that being said, I must admit that the story is very beautifully written and does a great job of creating to amazing beautiful mental pictures as you go.  It will make a very visually appealing movie.  And I liked the scenes in the nursing home where we really get to know Jacob the main charater.  And I loved the bond created bewteen all the circus people and the animals throughout the story.

One women in my book club felt it was a tad graphic and even though I agree to a point I felt it was necessary for us to see Jacob experience a world of unspoken truths.

As the book went on, I felt I was also living in this circus train and witnessing all the activities.My heart definitely melted when they acquired Rosie, the elephant and at the same time, I started loathing the character August for abusing the elephant so much. In addition to that, the performer Walter/Kinko also transformed into this loving person that looked out after others.About half way through the book, I think almost all readers wanted nothing more than Jacob and Marlena being together and the death of August and Uncle Al.

Not that it is bad but I really just did not quite get why it was important to keep his voice in. I did not see how old Jacob has contributed to the book and I think it could do without.Overall, I enjoyed the book so much and I was very happy to have resumed and finished it.

This is one of those stories where you think you've figure out exactly how everything is going to go . . .

Having Jacob's narration of the circus events interrupted by `present day Jacob' was a nice little detail. I definitely felt sad for the ninety-something year old, feeling nearly helpless and lonely. As he feels he's losing control of his life, his mind slips back to the past, and through these lapses we're told the story.I never knew anything about how circuses traveled about in the past, and hearing about the cutthroat America during the Great Depression certainly brought an overpowering feel of reality to the story. Jobs were few and far between, and those that had them did anything they could to keep them. Describing the desperate times, the hobo jungles, and the pay cuts served to present a great representation of the time period.I loved hearing about the different circus acts, though I know that was but a miniscule part of the story. The tiny facts and funniest little things kept my interest and had me smiling. This book is definitely dark and depressing at moments. At others, it is brilliantly bright and full of hope. Any novel that can pull off both sides of the spectrum nearly flawlessly is excellent in my book.I give Water for Elephants 5/5 stars.

I listened to this as an audio book and it was very well done; they have two readers one for Jacob in his twenties and one for Jacob in his nineties.  It was a good read and I enjoyed learning about the circus.Jacob is ninety three and living in a retirement home, through his dreams and daydreams he relives a tumultuous time in his life in his twenties.  When Jacob is in his twenties he is getting ready to sit for his Veterinarian finals at Cornell University when he gets a call; his parents have been killed in a car accident.  Then when he gets home he finds out that the bank has seized his parents' house.  In a fit of grief and sorrow he abandons his exams and hops a train that just happens to be part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  Through a series of circumstances he ends up working for them as their vet; taking care of the exotic animals in their menagerie.  In the process of all of this he falls in love with a beautiful performer named Marlena who has a brutally viscous husband, who also happens to be Jacob's boss.There were a number of things I liked about this book.  The story moves quickly and has a sense of mystery and doom about it as Jacob falls deeper into the seedy goings on in the circus and deeper in love with Marlena.  It is very engaging.It is clever how you see into Jacob's life in the present while he is in a nursing home.  These portions of the story really tug at your heart and give insight into an old man struggling to retain his sense of self in an environment where everything is sanitized and ordered.  These glimpses are bittersweet in contrast to the crazy life Jacob lived; obviously this man has lived and lived well and it is heartbreaking to watch him struggle with the descent into age that we are all faced with.The majority of the story is about Jacob's life in the circus.  Gruen doesn't shy away from the nitty gritty including sex, violence, language; as such this is definitely an adult read.  Issues such as animal cruelty, squalid living conditions for workers, and the Depression are woven throughout.  Making the story very believable and easy to relate to.All of the characters in this book are very human and engaging and have a lot of depth. Even the villainous characters (Al and August) have moments of graciousness and goodness.  While the main \\\"good\\\" characters do things that border on bad, if only through neglect.The only thing that really bothered me with this book is that I thought Jacob made too many bad decisions and too many mistakes.  I understood that he was young and hot-headed, but at the same time he is supposed to be very smart...and well...let's just say he doesn't spend much time thinking about his actions.  A lot of what happened he brought on himself and I think that this was inconsistent with the way he was presented as an upstanding citizen and character.The book ends well and should leave readers happy and smiling.  The story is expertly told and the look into the way a circus runs fascinating.  It would have been nice to have an afterward of Gruen talking about how accurately she represented the circus in this book.  Were all circuses like this?  Or was this one particularly bad?Overall this was a very engaging story, I enjoyed it a lot, and am happy that I read it.  The characters are fascinating, the glimpses into both life in the circus and life in a nursing home intriguing as well.  I loved how the book was set up with us seeing the elder Jacob's memories/story through his eyes.

She came to Fort Collins because her German Shephard needed open heart surgery, and while she was in town, she held a discussion/book signing at a local bookstore. Something she said struck me as rather odd. She said that she wanted the old circus photographs included in her novel because she didn't feel her readers would believe what she had written without the pictures. I'm not sure why she would feel this way, because as many reviewers have noted, her descriptions of the circus where the strongest parts of this novel.This was a book that I wanted to like better, but after all was said and done, it didn't leave much of an impression, other than her extensive research. The story, particularly the love story, was cliched, and the entire plot is predictable. Additionally, some parts of the story don't seem plausible. *SPOILER* For example, why would Jacob walk away from an Ivy League degree, needing only to complete a final exam? Yes, his parents were killed, but he knows that they made great sacrifices for him to attend Cornell. And what are the odds that when he jumps onto a passing train in the middle of the night, it just happens to be a circus train?In addition to the predictable plot, it was hard to relate to any of thecliched characters. I think it says a lot when the most interesting character in the book is Rosie the elephant. Jacob displays little or no character growth. And the book has a typical \\\"Hollywood\\\" ending where the good guys get everything they want, even though they've had to sacrifice virtually nothing. And some of the dialogue in this book reads like a romance novel.That said, there are flashes of quality in this novel. The sections that take place inside the nursing home are well done, and in fact, old Jacob is a more interesting character than young Jacob.I just wish that the author had taken as much care in plotting her book and developing her characters as she did in doing her research.\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"summary\": \"Mixed Emotions on this one.\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1240617600, \"reviewTime\": \"04 25, 2009\"}\n",

The book wonderfully captures place and time.  Set in the depression, it authentically  captures the spirit and feel of the era, including its description of the economics of the time, hobo life, the depression, etc.2.  It vibrantly and realistically describes life in the travelling circuses of the era, including the freaks and other performers, the pecking order between management, performers and workers, life on the train, stops for shows in the small communities, and vivid descriptions of the performances.3.  The characters have depth and breadth, and touch you with their humanity (which is sometimes kind and more often than not, evil--as humans can be).4.  The novel very effectively contrasts the protagonist's current situation in a nursing home with his recollections of the bulk of the novel's depression-era actions.5.  Without giving too much away, the novel very satisfyingly (if perhaps a bit unrealistically) concludes with a feel good ending--and who can resist a happy ending.In conclusion, this book is a decently written, plot driven, page turner, which tells a touching tale, set against a colorful background of time and place, populated by characters which are larger than life (yet realistic in thought and deed).

The contrast between the innocent young Jacob's foray into the rough-and-tumble world of a traveling circus and the old Jacob's cynical ruminations on life in a nursing home creates a \\\"book end\\\" effect that makes his story feel more real and meaningful.Gruen has also infused her novel with enough historical details to bring the sights, sounds and smells of the midway, menagerie and big top to life, without cramming in superfluous details that could have dragged on the story line.  The dialogue is sublime, especially the banter between the working men who handle the behind-the-scenes grunt work.  Her characterization is strong as well: I was moved by the star-crossed romance between Jacob and Marlena, repulsed by the evil of August and Uncle Al, and captivated by the antics of Rosie the elephant.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience, most deserving of its long run on the best-seller list.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Run Away With the Circus\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1188259200, \"reviewTime\": \"08 28, 2007\"}\n",

I was fascinated by this carefully researched, well-written look at the circus as a community with its own cultural norms, traditions, pecking order, and social bonds.A little-bit love story, a little-bit adventure,the underlying message is that individuals can overcome adversity if they are brave enough, or desperate enough, to take their lives into their own hands.This is the story of Jacob Jankowski, a Cornell vet student who loses everything in the Great Depression; parents, home, incipient career. Almost by accident he becomes a circus veterinarian. After a long and successful life, the elderly Jankowski escapes from a nursing home to once again join the Big Top.The author agiley shifts between Jacob's memories of circus life and his life in the nursing home. As Jacob's memories and present-day realities merge, the line between truth and fiction blurs. Perhaps Mr. Jankowski really did toddle off in his walker to be reabsorbed into the circus world; perhaps he died dreaming in his wheelchair.This is a lovely book; well-worth reading if you are interested in early twentieth-century history and/or the aging process.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Water for Elephants\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1322092800, \"reviewTime\": \"11 24, 2011\"}\n",

It is written with such elegance and grace, that each voice is like a piece of silk weaving in and out like a slice of humanity screaming to be heard.Jacob Jankouwski tells this unbelievable tale from a rest home at ninety or is it 93? And his memories are so lush and tragic that the reader will be transformed into his past along with him.Jacob enters the `circus life' by no desire of his own, but this world changes him beyond belief.  The reader will be changed, too, and utterly awakened by this world within a world.  The caste system at The Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth reminded me of working on the cruise ships----the engineers, waiters, and third country employees working below the ship (boiler room) and the showgirls, casino staff, and shop girls working and living above the ship--as if they were superior in some respect.Rosie, the elephant, becomes the voice for all animals, whom deserve respect and caring for.  She also becomes the voice for old folks, such as Jacob, who for some reason are tossed to the side because of old bones, old minds, and loss of memory.Oh, but Rosie has not lost her memory as the reader will see.  And the abusers will pay for their sins as we all do.Sara Gruen has created brilliant, memorable characters, people whom I fell in love with and cared deeply about.  For example, Walter, the dwarf, who was so hard and incredulous on the outside, but had a dog he adored like his own baby.  The characters are articulately developed, and one will even feel empathy for the hateful August.\\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is a book about humanity:  how it can be dark and light at the same time, how people can change, how others do not, how survival is connected to love, and above all, how giving water to elephants is like giving water to the world.I dreaded turning the last page, exiting the circus and all of its peculiarities and delights.

There are so many great things about this book, when you put it all together, it was just one of the best books I've ever read.The point of view for Water for Elephants is unique. Jacob, the main character, comes to us first as a 90 (or is it 93?) year old man who is living in a seniors home. Most of the story is Jacob recalling his life with the circus, with short trips back to his here-and-now. I felt that I came to know all of Jacob. From his beginning, losing his parents in an accident, to his experience with the circus and his true love, to his last days feeling trapped in a body and mind that he wasn't free to control himself any longer.With the story being set in the 1930's and in the Depression, the book was even more interesting to read about days in that era.

Obviously traveling with the circus is going to make for some really interesting stories.There are many details throughout the book that I didn't think were nearly as bad as others have made them out to be in these other reviews on Amazon.-The sexual content really wasn't that explicit.  There were maybe two sex scenes and they really weren't that bad.  If you want explicit sex in the middle of a fiction story (without being considered erotic fiction) read John Irving's \\\"The World According to Garp\\\" and/or \\\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\\" and/or \\\"The Fourth Hand\\\" and/or \\\"The 158-Pound Marriage\\\".  All very good books that have way more detailed sex scenes that may or may not make you squeamish.  \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" barely grazed the surface of reproductive organs and whatnot.  So, if you're worried about that, don't be.-The animal cruelty also was not that bad.  Yes, it is written that someone would walk off and you could hear the animal cry out, but... other than that- it wasn't detracting from the entire story.  And not only that, but, I'm sure things like that really happen on the road.  There are definitely people who are capable of doing such things.  If you watch any show on \\\"Animal Planet\\\" or watch any real animal documentaries on late night television, you'll see that things are much worse.  So, if you're leery of the cruelty content, don't be.  It is also grazed over.There are many real elements- as far as I can tell- and whether or not the research was done before writing the novel, I think the descriptions are pretty believable.The only characters that really stood out were Walter and (in the beginning) Camel.  Jacob was a very strong narrator, but I didn't care for his burst of love for Marlena (a married performer).The back story behind Marlena and August's marriage was important, but it was summed up in about two paragraphs.The story behind Uncle Al's creation of the circus was interesting, but we barely meet Uncle Al.  And both August and Uncle Al seem to be bi-polar, which was annoying and unnecessary.  It is okay for there to be \\\"normal\\\" performers.  I don't think it was needed to move the story along or to qualify their actions.Most of the characters are added as bodies, but none have interesting or \\\"deep\\\" back stories.  To make it easier to remember their names and who they are (as the names are mentioned often), it would have been better for me to know more about these guys so that they really stick out in my mind as real people.There was nothing memorable about Camel by the end either- he lost his appeal about halfway through the book.Walter was interesting and probably my favorite character.Marlena was a bother.  I didn't get the whole tragedy of her marriage to August and felt that his temper was added in as only an excuse to make her want to be with Jacob.  The tangled love story wasn't even as interesting (to me) as the whole circus thing:  Redlighting and setting up the stage, and canceled wages, and the whole life of a circus performer.By the middle of the book, people started to become \\\"missing\\\" and/or dead, but I didn't care about those characters anyway- so, it seemed like those events were added just to make \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" interesting as a whole.This is my first Sara Gruen book, but it felt like \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" was a first novel for her too- though it was written well, the plot kind of fell flat by the middle of the story.  It was entertaining enough to finish, but I probably won't be recommending it.  I may try her again, in the future, but...

The pathetic circus Jacob joined was full of lively characters, some kindly, others cruel, and Jacob was forced to grow from naive youth to courageous man.  There were many pages that reduced me to sobs, especially those detailing the agonizing despair of some nursing home residents and some instances of animal cruelty at the circus.I would have given this book five stars, but I didn't like that it was written in the first person (which immediately takes away some suspense as to the future of the narrator), and it was written entirely in the present tense which struck me as awkward.

Jacob is your typical old man. He's seen too much in his life to give a crap what people say and think. From the first line Jacob spoke, I knew I loved him. He was sarcastic and funny, but also sad and lonely. His wife died a few years before, and his children and grandchildren only visit him in the nursing home for a few hours on Sunday.

It was a beautiful sight!).At 23, Jacob is about to graduate veterinary school and go on to work for his father caring for animals. When his parents die in a car accident, he learns that his parents left him with no money and the bank repossessed their home (it takes place during the depression, and the Jankowski's were struggling along with everyone else). Jacob, having no where to turn, jumps unto a moving train and in this moment his life will change forever.Water for Elephants has an amazing cast of characters that all bring something to the story. Jacob meets the beautiful, Marlena, her charming, but sadistic husband, August, as well as many others that all shape Jacob's life one way or another. Even the animals play a huge role in his life!I think my favorite part of this story was the last few pages. Not because it was over, but everything came together so beautifully.

Not every page was perfection I will admit but my annoyance was due to my own impatience about wanting to get back to a certain character rather than learning a bit more about another.It is quite clear from the moment you begin that the author did some seriously extensive research about the Depression era in general and circus life specifically.The way the author weaves the story between present day and older Jacob (at 90 or 93, he can't quite remember) and the flashbacks to the past (when Jacob was in his 20's) are fantastic.

She weaved the anecdotes together with a love story worthy of a three-hanky weepie from the 1930s. The combination of grit and sweetness works only to a point, but the inherently interesting nature of the subject matter managed to hold my interest to the end.To me, however, Gruen never managed to transcend her source material.  The primary problem was the narrator's voice.  Although the book was sprinkled with circus-specific vocabularly of that era, Gruen utterly fails to capture the rhythm or syntax of the time or milieu. Gruen's language felt inappropriately contemporary, which undermined the overall credibility of the story.  The subject matter cried out for a writer with an ear for the street; I kept thinking about what Damon Runyon or Ring Lardner could have done with this material.The other major problem was that Gruen over-anthropomophized and over-romanticized the animals in the story.  Gruen could have honored the animals' intelligence -- and decried the brutality of their treatment -- without veering into fantasy.In the end, while I wasn't sorry I read the book, I would have preferred to read a non-fiction account of life in the Depression-era circus from a first hand source rather than this watered down trifle.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Doesn't Transcend The Source Material\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1162684800, \"reviewTime\": \"11 5, 2006\"}\n",

The main charachter is in his nineties now, but we get to travel back in time through him, to this time in U.S. history and experience how a traveling circus worked back then.  It is such a richly written story, you will not want to put it down.  The desperation of the times, the way people lived, their expectations, their feelings, etc. are all here.  I have recommended this book to multiple friends, which I rarely do.  You will not be disappointed with this story.  There are no low points that drag.  It's a green light read from start to finish.

I put this aside for awhile, trying to avoid all of the hype this book has received, but I am definitely glad I finally picked it up.Told from the point of view of his 93-year old self as he relives his life through his dreams, Jacob, a then-student about to finish gain his veterinary degree at the prestigious ivy league, Cornell, is abruptly summoned home to identify the bodies of his parents, who have tragically died in a car accident.  Left with no money, no practice, and no home, he starts to walk, unsure of where his once bright future now lies.  He stumbles upon the train of the Benzini Brothers circus.  The show's ringmaster, Uncle Al, whose ultimate goal is to \\\"one-up\\\" the more prominent Ringling circus, takes Jacob on as a vet to the animals in the show (because of course, if Ringling has a vet, he needs one too).Life on a circus train, however isn't all it's cracked up to be, and the circus and country has fallen on hard times & the working men find that more and more of their co-workers have been redlighted (tossed off the train in the dead of night) in order to cut costs.  With being redlighted as a real possibility, workers have to do their part to earn their place on the train and work hard not to make the wrong people angry, often without pay.As Jacob adjusts to life as part of a circus, he finds foes, friends who become family, and of course the love interests of the married star of the show! A tangled mess of jealous, mental illnesses, and the struggle to simply survive unfolds as the memories of his life come back to the 93-year old man in the nursing home.Definitely one of the best books I've read of all time, with 100% ability to become one of the classics that children will one day read in their English classes.

I wanted to love it, I really did, but something just fell flat. The story was good, although I found the flashing back and forth distracting, and Sara Gruen obviously did copious amounts of research, but I just couldn't get excited about it.The character of Marlena could have been a really interesting and multi-layered person, but instead she is really only presented as a delicate flower who loves animals, married a psychopath, and sometimes displays teenage acts of defiance. Why did Jacob love her so much? There must have been more to her than that, but the reader is never let in on that secret. It's even more odd because the author is a woman. They had strong female personalities in the 1930s, I'm sure of it.As for Jacob, I thought that he displayed a lot of the conflict and inner questioning that you like to see in a lead character and his development as he gets to know the people that work for the circus was enjoyable. His relationship with the animals was obviously meant to heal him after the death of his parents, but again, I felt like that connection was rushed and then brushed aside. His relationship with Rosie, the gentle and abused Polish speaking (well, Polish understanding) elephant, was an excellent metaphor for his own gentle nature and his inability to stand up for himself and break free. Of course, in the end, everyone is free thanks to Rosie and we get the happy ending.I did not hate the book at all, but I wanted more from it. I think if the author had been allowed to write about 100 pages more, it could have been a great novel instead of just ok. The descriptions of the 1930s era circus and the care she took in researching every detail made the book very interesting.

The enactment of the young Jacob by David LeDoux was good, but a little bit monotonous in tone.  He did do a good job on the other characters' voices, making them sound different from Jacob.  The book was well-written, with excellent characters who all had distinct personalities, and dialogue that rang true.  I bought the depression era plight of a young veterinary student doubly shocked at losing his parents and then their home.  This made a credible segue to his becoming the veterinarian for the Benzini Brothers circus.  Ms. Gruen does a believable portrayal of the Depression era, the working class, and the animals in the menagerie.  The story flows well, but is a bit melodramatic to my taste, in spots.  The love story between Jacob and Marlena works, but is a little long in development.  At first I did not see the relevance of the old Jacob interludes in the story, but they did lead to a sweet and appropriate ending to the book.I have one issue which maybe someone could answer.  I don't understand the relationship of the prologue to the rest of the book.  The text of the prologue duplicates the climactic event of the book itself, yet has a completely different outcome, and one that contradicts what happened \\\"in real life\\\".  I don't understand why there should be such a contradiction, and it wasn't explained by something like \\\"and then I woke up from the dream\\\".  Instead, the prologue merely ends with \\\"in 70 years I never told a single soul\\\" or something like this.  So why do we have a difference of fact between two parts of the book?

The situations the elder Jacob went through while at the nursing home, were really poignant and beautifully written (albeit, sad). You really felt for Jacob, and it was a bird's-eye-view on what it is like to age as you feel the same mentally and yet your body betrays you, no longer being able to keep up with your needs and desires.The characters were really fleshed out, especially August.  Even Rosie seemed like an actual person herself. The interactions of Jacob with the animals were really touching, especially because a lot of it touched Jacob's inner monologue about many things but also of his passion for taking care of these creatures.The relationship between Jacob and Marlena rang true for me, and were a bit reminiscent of the two lead characters in Nicholas Sparks' \\\"The Notebook,\\\" but BETTER!I absolutely adored the ending, it was whimsical and inspiring. There is nothing better than finishing a story and feeling content with the journey you just undertook.

The book is told through the eyes of 90 (or 93) year old Jacob Jankowski, as he recounts the events of that fateful year of 1931.When Jacob Janowski's parents are killed in a car accident just before his graduation from Cornell veterinary school he runs away and somehow ends up working for the Benzini Brothers circus after they learn he is almost a doctor. The harshness of both the ever encompassing depression and circus life is brought vividly to life. We meet the side show `freaks', the stars, the roustabouts and rubes and come to care for many of them, especially Walter, the educated dwarf.  The story centers on Jacob and his falling in love with the beautiful star of the equestrian show, Marlena, who is married to the questionably sane August who is the animal trainer.  It also involves the wonderful elephant Rosie, who is brought in as the star of the menagerie, but seems to have her own ideas about that.The ending is incredibly poignant and brought a smile to my face, as it brought the whole story full circle.

Now, Jacob could have gone back and finished the test.

As it turns out, I just finished it and quite simply, it's fantastic. Set in both present time and the 1920's, it tells the tale of young Jacob Jankowski's circus days: how he stumbled upon the spectacle, how he made himself useful, and how he found true love. Told through flashbacks of himself at ninety...or ninety three, a fact he keeps forgetting, you see how the circus life effected him and what became of him after his years under the big top.After leaving Cornell, Jacob made his way onto the Benzini Brothers most Spectacular Show on Earth, a not as good as Ringling Brothers, but still decent traveling circus. He became the show's veterinarian, watching over the lions, chimps, horses, and, of course, elephant. There, he meets a dazzling array of characters including Walter, the show's midget clown; Earl, the strong man; Uncle Al, the show's ringmaster and owner; August, the moody and arrogant animal keeper; and his wife Marlena, the lovely horse tamer and elephant rider that Jacob falls for.Accompanied by archived photos from the Ringling Circus Museum, the book accurately portrays the life of a traveling circus member, riding the train daily going from city to city, hoping the town is looking for an afternoon of entertainment. In a time when entertainment was scarce, the circus really was a legendary spectacle. Money was tight and the sleeping quarters were tighter. The performers were treated like Gods, but the workers were seen as slaves. But when you were living cent by cent, it was a job--and a good job at that.As a reader, you're wrapped up my Jacob's tale, following him through his four month stay with the Benzini Brothers. You cheer him on and fear for his life all at the same time. You become attached, friends. And the ending leaves you satisfied, fulfilled and content.Personally, I was disappointed that they didn't concentrate more on the acts, however that's a small complaint from an otherwise fantastic read. Even for those who have no interest or knowledge of the circus lifestyle will get something out of it. Because at one time we've all seen the show. We've all seen the clowns, the elephants, and the acrobats. We've all eaten the pop corn and cotton candy sold from the striped tents.

That's my general rule after all.  And I was sorely disappointed.In this historical novel, Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, has left Vetrinary school at Cornell after suffering the loss of his parents, who have died in a tragic car accident.  He learns fairly quickly that his father, also a vet, was heavily in debt and actually died owing money.  So Jacob leaves school and his home and literally joins the circus. He travels cross country with the circus, acting as the show's vetrinarian and working under August, the head trainer and Uncle Al, the show's ringleader.  August is an interesting man, alternately charming and brutal.  He's also married to the beautiful Marlena, a performer, that Jacob forms a special bond with. This novel is about Jacob's relationship with Marlena, with the new elephant, Rosie and with Uncle Al.There are definitely several themes that are prevalent in this novel, which are super easy to pick out.  Water is for cleansing, for instance and the train tracks are for choosing a life path.I was not impressed by this book at all.  The themes were easy to spot and the ending was just as easy to spot.  The characters were shallow and one dimensional and I found myself annoyed with them more often than I was intrigued by them.

The descriptions of the circus, the towns, and the train travel with all the animals seemed so authentic. However, I thought that canceling several shows and rushing west to buy an elephant and book someone for a sideshow seemed to be stretching things a bit. The expenses to feed all the animals and the employees would have been huge. I kept thinking this would have been handled by having either Big Al or one of his managers travel alone and make the transaction while the show went on back East. Other than that part, though, I was completely drawn in. I thought Jacob and Marlena made a wonderful couple. Marlena, by the time she met Jacob, already needed rescuing. And Jacob was a gentleman, who responded not only to her beauty and talent, but to her need for rescue. It's not surprising to me that they quickly fell for each other. My other favorite characters were Walter, a dwarf, and Rosie, the elephant.The circus part of the book was set in 1931, a time when people would take just about any job and put up with a lot of abuse to keep it if they had to. This helped to make some of the events more interesting and believable. The rest of the story is told by the 93-year-old Jacob and the author did a superb job of portraying the world from the point of view of someone who's in a care center and isn't always allowed to make his own choices. The switches back and forth between the two Jacobs were flawless and really help make the story. The ending was perfect, exactly what I would have wished for Jacob.

Jacob Jankowski resides in an assisted living home with other elderly people, many of whom require more medical attention than he.  He is quite mentally astute for his age, yet because of his age, most of the people in charge of the facility treat him as mentally incompetent, all but Rosemary, a forty-seven-year-old nurse, who treats him and the rest of the patients/residents with the loving care, dignity, and respect they deserve as human beings.  But she is moving away and will be quitting the facility, which in the end leads to Jacob's decision to continue his life--what little he may have left--in dignity.There is a circus that has come to town.  It is so close to the facility that the big tent and other goings on can be observed from the window.  All of the old people reminisce about their experiences in their youth going to the circus.  One old man and a newcomer to the home, Mr. Joseph McGuinty, who is considerably younger than Jacob, brags about having worked in a circus, carrying \\\"water for elephants.\\\"  Jacob becomes upset because he knows Mr. McGuinty is lying to attract the attention of the other residents; and the memories of the truth of his past life are triggered.Flashback to young Jacob Jankowski, a veterinary student at Cornell University in his last year!  Just before he is scheduled to take his final exams, after which he will graduate and receive his degree, both his parents are killed in an automobile accident.  After their burial and after learning the truth of his financial situation, Jacob is unable to focus.  He leaves the exam room and leaves Cornell.  Distraught, he leaves with only the clothes on his back and no money in his pocket.Because of the Depression, people were unable to pay for his father's services; and his father, also a veterinarian, worked for people even though they could not pay him, taking whatever they could give him--eggs, chickens, whatever they had.  Therefore, his parents had nothing to leave their son but debts.  To pay his tuition, the house had been mortgaged.So not being able to focus, he leaves without ever putting pen to paper.  Without aim or destination, he walks and soon finds himself beside the railroad tracks, when along comes a train.  Like a hobo, he hops the train with no idea where he is going.  He soon learns this is a circus train and is not tossed off it because the Benzini Brothers, whose circus it is, discover he is a veterinarian; and his services are badly needed.Working as a veterinarian that summer leads to all kinds of experiences, tantamount among them which are falling in love, getting married, and eventually working with the circus's one elephant.After his summer with the Benzini Brothers, he is hired by Ringling Brothers.  He, along with his wife and his growing family, spends seven years as a circus veterinarian.  He then becomes the veterinarian for the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.  His seven years experience with exotic animals and his degree, in addition to bringing an elephant with him, insures him the job when the former vet suddenly dies.Jacob, ninety years old--or is he 93? he asks himself, recognizing that his old age has caused some memory loss--struggles to hold onto his humanity and his dignity as long as he can.  It is he who in his reminiscences about his circus life, his friendships, and his deep love for his wife narrates the story.  The reader falls in love with Jacob and develops an even greater love and respect for \\\"old folks.\\\"  Sara Gruen's novel awakens the reader to the often mistreatment of and disrespect for the elderly, evoking empathy in their cause.  Especially hurtful is seeing how their own families, their own children, mistreat them, or forget about them.  Old people are still human beings.  In many cases, their bodies may be broken, their hands and fingers gnarled, but in all cases, there is a brain inside their heads as Jacob proves.  In having Jacob tell his story in Water for Elephants, the author informs us of this and reminds us of the fact that we will grow old someday.  At the same time Sara Gruen affords us a moving and delightful read--so do not be misled by the title.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Respect for the Elderly\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1213660800, \"reviewTime\": \"06 17, 2008\"}\n",

There are over 2,600 reviews already and I doubt I'll be able to add anything new or groundbreaking.  My mom and my friend have been trying to get me to read Water For Elephants for the past couple of years, but I've resisted.  I didn't want to read this book for a few reasons, namely - the subject matter (a traveling circus) didn't really excite me, the idea of an old man telling the story in a sort of flashback manner reminded me too much of The Notebook (of which I only saw the movie), and most of all, I didn't want to read this story because I absolutely adore animals and I knew there would be parts about abuse that would be difficult for me to read.  But now that the movie has come out, I knew it was time to give it a go.  Books are always so much better than movies and I wanted to check this novel off my list before it possibly became tainted by Robert Pattinson's portrayal.... just in case.  :)If, like me, you also have these reservations - don't let them stop you.  Yes, the story is rather sad in parts, and it will make your heart break, but it's so much more.  It took me a while to really get in to the story, but I absolutely tore through the last 200 or so pages.

There are vivid, graphic descriptions of everything and you feel like you're right there with these characters.

On the other hand, he doesn't do so well with some of the people.

He is the self-appointed Protector of the Downtrodden who makes a dangerous mistake: he falls in love with Marlena, an animal act performer who is married to the brutal August, the menagerie supervisor.

It's uniquely told from the perspective of one character at two different stages of his life; Jacob at 20 and again when he was 93 and living in a nursing home. The story moves seamlessly between these two timelines and although I was more intrigued by the introspective old Jacob, the complexity and volatility of young Jacob also captured my attention, just on a different more concrete level. The book touches on what's important at different phases of life. The story is sweet, tragic and entertaining and the emotions that surface range from sad and lonely to happy and in love. In short, the story is haunting and brings to light the strong bond that develops between man and animal and shows the true meaning of friendship. An excellent selection for those who enjoy a good character driven story.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Really hit home on the bond between man and animal\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1309651200, \"reviewTime\": \"07 3, 2011\"}\n",

I would have found him more attractive had he been more discerning.  As it was, I would not have been surprised had Marlena really not been attracted to him.  Also, I wondered if a talented circus performer such as Marlena was, would not have had to start very young instead of at the age of 17 when she left home and married August.

The authors love of animals and the tremendous research she did for this novel make it not only a fascinating portrayal of life, ugly and vibrant in the American circus of the 1930's but a beautiful and tender love story. I had never even heard of circus trains until I read this either and learning a little something when I read also appeals to me.The title had been on my wishlist for awhile so I was delighted to obtain a copy recently and wanted to get on with reading so that I can see the film, which has been recommended to me.Since seeing elephants up close in Thailand, I also have more understanding of just how intelligent they are. Wonderful creatures which will treat humans well if they are given the respect they deserve. Sara Gruen portrays the nature of the elephant perfectly, for me Rosie was the real protagonist of the novel. The novel is told as two separate but connected stories, as well as being immersed in the circus world, we are also given an inside view of a home for the elderly where the hero of the story Jacob is now living. Again the author has done her research as the scenes in the nursing home were poignant and all too familiar to me in many ways.When the novel starts Jacob Jankowski is in his nineties and living in a nursing home and the imminent arrival of the circus in town revives some very stirring memories for the old man and it is these that are told in the other storyline.It is the American Depression and when Jacob's parents die while he is studying veterinary science at university, he discovers that they were in dire financial difficulties and he cannot even afford to complete his studies. Confused and bewildered with no plans for his future he finds himself hitching a ride on a circus train and in that moment his whole life changes. By the following morning he finds himself working for the travelling circus and by that evening he has met and fallen for the woman who will for evermore be the love of his life. Marlena, the star performer, however the love should remain unrequited as she is married to August the strangely mad animal trainer. Of course it is not long either before he also meets my particular favourite, Rosie the elephant. Whilst struggling to survive in the world of this second rate travelling circus this young couples love overcomes obstacles that you can not begin to imagine.The two stories are ultimately woven together but to find out just how you will have to read for yourself.

Water for Elephants has been lauded as a \\\"great pick for summer\\\", but this book is so much more.

It's obvious that the author did her research into the time period (post-Depression America), and the subject matter (traveling circuses).  According to the author's note at the end of the book, many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events, culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers. As a result, Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative.The main character is a cantankerous, still-sharp 93-year-old man, and his frustration at being trapped in an old man's body is palpable. The story of his incredible life and adventures with the Benzini Brothers circus unfolds in a way that is emotionally wrenching, and yet flashes of good humor pervade throughout. The characters are richly drawn, and even the animals are given complex personalities that make them a pivotal part of the story.

But sadly, animal circuses haven't changed much since that time.  Human workers may no longer be \\\"redlighted\\\", but captive wild animals are still packed into buses or trains without heat in winter or air conditioning in summer, imprisoned in cages or chained up, forced to perform demeaning tricks for the public, and given generally substandard, if any, medical care and often, not enough nourishment.Gruen can tell a story, she has vivid characters, she presented the animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light, and I enjoyed the read.  But I have to say that to me, the happy ending of Jacob and Marlena finding employment with Ringling Brothers so they can bring Rosie, Bobo and the horses along with them is anything but.  Admittedly, for those times, it may have been the only option open to them, and there were few if any animal protection advocates out there exposing circuses like Ringling.  The truth is that Ringling Brothers has a long history of well-documented animal abuse, particularly of elephants, something Ms. Gruen never refers to in her novel--although, to her credit, she talks about the infamous, unbelievably cruel execution of Topsy by electrocution of none other than American paragon Thomas Edison.  It's also quite unrealistic that they would be able to keep an adult chimp as a pet, especially with five children of their own to care for and protect.  Chimps become quite intractable as adults; they're extremely strong, unpredictable and dangerous.I can't help thinking that the happy ending to a circus novel set in the 21st century would have Rosie sent to a place like The Elephant Sanctuary to spend her remaining life blissfully roaming hundreds of acres with other former circus and zoo elephants, and Bobo retiring to a wonderful sanctuary like Save the Chimps, where he would join a chimp family and have the closest thing to a normal life a captive ape can have.  And Jacob getting a job at a zoo so he can take Rosie along after his circus career is also not a very cheery outcome for me.  There's no question that zoo elephants lead short, painful, highly restricted lives, and many zoos are in the process of retiring their elephants to sanctuaries.Also, it's quite unbelievable to me that after Jacob witnessed so much brutality while working for circuses earlier in his life, he would want to join a circus again rather than live in a nursing home.  That speaks volumes about that nursing home!Lastly, I understand that the author considers herself an animal lover, but that can mean a lot of things, and I'm wondering exactly what her agenda was, writing this book.\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"summary\": \"Brutality of animal circuses hasn't changed much\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1230249600, \"reviewTime\": \"12 26, 2008\"}\n",

Hopping a train that by chance belongs to The Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, Jacob hires on to care for the menagerie, his training an entre into this bizarre world; but as the novel begins, Jacob is an old man, restricted to an assisted living home, his memories sparked by a nearby visiting circus and a creeping helplessness that assaults his ageing body: \\\"Age is a terrible thief. Just when you think you're getting the hang of it, it knocks your legs out from under you and stoops your back.\\\"The story is related in the somber tones of the Depression, the hardscrabble and often unscrupulous business of a traveling circus and the heartless despots who make their fortunes on the backs of men who must do anything to survive. Star performer Marlena, an equestrian, is sensitive to the needs of her horses, although her mercurial husband, August, the trainer, is obsessively jealous and given to unspeakable cruelties. Uncle Al, Benzini Brothers circus owner-by-default, is a ruthless businessman who cares little for man or beast, engaged in a quest for fame to rival the great Ringling Brothers. With his advanced training in veterinary medicine, Jacob does his best to protect the animals from their harsh existence, especially Rosie, an elephant purchased to replace Marlena's lead horse. Jacob and Rosie share an affinity for one another, the huge creature at times almost human. Because of his growing affection for Marlena, Jacob suffers August's increasing affronts, caught in a cycle of inevitable violence, certain of a reckoning.In chapters that move flawlessly back and forth in time, from the rowdy circus atmosphere to the antiseptic corridors of the assisted living home, the world is viewed through Jacob's perspective, as he rages helplessly against the decrepitude of old age and the secrets of the past. In prose both poignant and infinitely tender, Jacob dwells in both worlds, revealing the wounds of the past and the sorrows of the present. In one touching scene, Jacob awaits a family member to escort him to the circus, yearning for the Big Top with every fiber of his being, craving the familiar sights and smells of that pivotal summer of `31, the roustabouts, the kinkers, the rubes, the animals. The denouement is devastating, as inescapable as the indifferent world that turns a blind eye to the vagrants of the 30's. Yet Jacob's spirit retains the essence of his kind nature and a respect for others, a man who will not be broken by circumstances. All is redeemed in a coup d'grace that will leave the reader strangely satisfied and richer for having met this raggedy tribe of miscreants and lost souls.

I couldn't put it down and read the entire book in a day. I was absolutely captivated. Each incident, each character, the plot, the time-frame - every aspect of this book was simply amazing and I was even brought to tears twice.What a perfect setting. The Great Depression - the time when the great circus shows began to lose their prowess as the best kind of entertainment. But the Benzini Brothers circus isn't the fun, song-and-dance circus that everyone thinks of from movies like 'The Greatest Show on Earth', 'Merry Andrew' or even Disney's 'Dumbo'. This circus is a delight on the surface, but a nasty, dirty, dangerous and deadly place to be if you're not a performer. (And even some of the performers get the boot - like poor Walter the dwarf clown.)This kind of circus gives a taste of what spectators and boys who dream of running away to join the circus would never imagine.The method of Jacob's memoirs - alternating between his life now at 93 years old - still sharp minded and still having all of his teeth, stuck in a nursing home and feeling horribly depressed about it all, and remembering what happened during his time with the Benzini Brothers Circus - is an incredible technique. One minute I was drawn in by his angst of losing his parents, his home and his security to the point of jumping the next train to anywhere, and then suddenly, we are back in the nursing home, and poor Jacob is fighting with a fellow resident about the possibility of carrying water for elephants.Add the vulturous Uncle Al, the wicked ringmaster who'll stop at nothing to make his circus better than the Ringling Bros., the schizophrenic August, beautiful Marlena, a half-paralyzed drunk, a cranky dwarf and his little dog, Queenie, and an elephant who only understands Polish. The characters alone are enough to make you want to read before you even know half of what is going on.As I said, twice I was brought to tears - once by old Jacob in the nursing home, when he realizes that his five children had forgotten who was to take him on his outing, and he was actually brought to tears himself. I just couldn't help but think of my own 90 year old grandfather, who isn't in assisted living and drives himself and my grandmother to Florida every winter and goes bowling and plays shuffleboard every week. It was sad to think of poor Jacob, excited about getting to see the circus one last time, and then being terribly disappointed that his own children had forgotten. It made me feel like I will never let that happen to my grandfather.No one who reads this book will be disappointed. From cover to cover, it is absolutely wonderful. The writing style is simple and easy to understand. There is no 'filler' - unnecessary, boring descriptions or dialogue that has nothing to do with the story. It is an excellent novel and although I could rave some more about my favorite characters and my favorites scenes and so on, I will simply say that it is a must-read.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Water for Elephants\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1154736000, \"reviewTime\": \"08 5, 2006\"}\n",

The story is told through the mind of Jacob, a nonogenarian (yes, I had to look that up) resident of a nursing home, who was orphaned his last week of veterinary school.  Jacob discovers that his parents, struggling along with everyone else through the end of the Great Depression, had impoverished themselves to keep him in college.  Broke himself, and unable to focus enough to complete his exams, he desperately jumps a train and runs away from his life.The train he jumps happens to belong to The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  Barely avoiding getting thrown off the train, he is befriended by a few of the circus workers, and becomes the veterinarian for the show's menagerie of exotic animals.This look behind the scenes of the train circuses is enough in itself to carry the book.  Sara Gruen's ability to place herself behind the eyes of a 93 (or is it 90?) year-old man is gripping.  The two combined give the story a depth that makes you want to keep turning the pages.The flaws in the story are not enough to make it founder but just enough to keep this from being a five-star read.  In particular, Jacob's ability to turn his back when those he loves are endangered is at odds with what we see of his nature at other times.  The encapsulated explanations for his behavior notwithstanding, his integrity is deeply flawed in a manner that can't be explained away, and yet the author ignores it.  We are thus left cheated from seeing not just how Jacob affects the circus, but how deeply the circus affects Jacob.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Excellent read!\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1294531200, \"reviewTime\": \"01 9, 2011\"}\n",

I assumed this was Gruen's first novel and was quite surprised to find out it was her third.The morality of the story fell very flat as well.  The characters kind of want to do the right thing, but I wasn't sold on their move toward adultery based on initial attraction.  A lot of people feel an attraction toward someone who is not their spouse.  That doesn't mean it is right or destined.  Greun's inability to convince me that Jacob and Marlena were any different was a major failing of the novel for me.How many meals can people in the Great Depression skip without even thinking about it.  At least a dozen times through the book people skipped meals because they didn't feel like eating.I had high expectations so I'm judging harshly.  Did not meet expectations.

The implausible adventures of the protagonist Jacob, a veterinary student who joins the circus, Marlena, the married acrobat he loves, the circus animals in Jacob's care, and the oddball, desperate circus folk, keep you in suspense and turning the pages. Gruen risks ridicule with her over-the-top romantic ending, which I won't give away, but there's something endearing about her having taken that risk.

Reading this tale makes you believe you are on board this Depression-era circus train, complete with all the sounds and smells.A great novel must combine such a travelouge with interesting, human characters, and Sara Gruen has accomplished that.  The New Yorker review complained that the protagonist, Jacob, was not interesting because he was \\\"relentlessly decent.\\\"  Apparently the idea that some people really are decent escaped the jaded reviewer.  Also, Jacob certainly commits his share of moral transgressions (and is ready to commit murder) in the course of his growth into the decent man who so bored the New Yorker.The Publisher's Weekly reviewer complained of a predictable ending, and that's not true, either: it took me until the last chapter to see where Jacob's journey would end, and the final twist is a heartwarming one.  Maybe that's what some too-cynical professional reviewers really don't like: the idea that, in literature as in real life, some stories are uplifting ones.I'm a writer as well as a voracious and nit-picking reader, and I don't give five-star reviews.

The story is set during the 1930's depression and takes place primarily on a traveling circus train.  Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned, is hired as the veterinarian for the circus. Through Jacob's gaze, we are introduced to the inner workings of the greatest show on earth as proclaimed by Uncle Al, owner of the Benzini Brothers circus.  We learn of the work required to roll out and pick up a circus as well as the cruelty with which the men charged with this work are treated.  While the animals, performances and circus atmosphere are well rendered by the author I found the class structure created within the traveling circus of particular interest; a structure whereby the lowest members of the circus team may be guaranteed a meal but not necessarily a wage or a life.  Equally interesting to me is the depiction of geriatric care, familial and professional, afforded Jacob during his twilight years.  Gruen did an excellent job of capturing the desolation of aging without the care and proximity of your family.\\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is a well crafted tale of adventure, love and murder.  The characters are memorable and the language easily accessible and imagistic.  This is an entertaining read but I must admit it dispelled any quixotic notions that I associate with running off with the circus; that was hard and dangerous work then. You were luck if you left the show with your life and even luckier if you left with a life.  For this reader, It'll be enough to watch the next circus that comes to town and remember the men and women that whose hard work made it possible then and keeps the show on the road now.

For Jacob Jankowski, the circus is just about a last chance that fate has given him after some untimely luck.  Joining with the Benzini Brothers to care for their animals, Jacob is launched into a world that's strange and unusual for him, and provides the backdrop for reminiscing when he's 90 and in a nursing home many years later.With vivid imagery, you're taken into the world of the circus and into the lives of these characters.  The characters themselves are very believable and fleshed out, especially August the animal trainer.  His viciousness and mood swings were gripping and his evolution into the bad guy had me sitting there waiting for more.  And as the husband of Marlena, Jacob's romantic interest, August had plenty of opportunity to be jealous and controlling.  Even secondary characters were well formed and fleshed out, giving the book even more life and character.  Even Rosie the elephant becomes a character that you fall in love with by the end of the book.The author tackles a bunch of interesting subjects and has obviously researched them all thoroughly.  From the drinking of Sterno fluid during Prohibition and its effects afterwards to the history of the circus originally as an event for men to get on with their hoochy koochy stuff, Gruen provides a well researched take on everything.  This research shows and if you're a history nut like me you will not be disappointed.What I had a slight problem with was the love story.  It was very sweet, but it was also somewhat stereotypical.  Boy comes along and becomes the knight in shining armor to the damsel in distress.  It was still a believable, romantic, and heartwarming love story, and it makes you remember that back in the day, people thought that women were property of men.  Even in the circus with people protecting one another there was no escape from domestic violence.The story in the past and in the nursing home blended seamlessly and the transitions were impeccable.  Gruen crafted a well researched and well written love story that, though with its small faults, was a very good novel.  Gruen is definitely an author that I want to watch and read more of.VERDICT: Even though it suffers from a stereotypical romance, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a well-crafted, heartwarming novel that keeps you glued to your seat wanting more of the circus and the atmosphere.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"A heartwarming, enchanting book you'll want to check out\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1320019200, \"reviewTime\": \"10 31, 2011\"}\n",

Written as a historical novel, it reminded me very much of Nicholas Spark's The Notebook, with the main character being an elderly man and telling the story through memories of his youth.Preparing to take his final exams as a veterinary student at university, Jacob Jankowski receives some shocking news about his family which sends his future into a spin. Abandoning his exams, he leaves school and hops on board a train in the middle of the night. This train is home to a travelling circus, and it's through the characters he meets there that he becomes a vet to the animals on board and enters a world he never imagined. He quickly becomes part of the family and is soon caught up in a love triangle with the beautiful Marlena, a circus performer who holds a particular soft spot for the star of the show, an intelligent and lovable elephant, Rosie.The novel is so beautifully written and will touch the hearts of all animal lovers.

I knew I would eventually see the movie so I looked up the book to see what it was about.  When I read the many positive reviews, I figured I should go ahead and read it before I saw the movie.  When the Kindle edition dropped to $4.17, I figured I wouldn't be out much money.  I am very happy I did.The story flowed very well and the writing was easy and accessible without seeming juvenile.  I found myself drawn to the older Jacob. Right out of high school, I worked at an assisted living home while attending college and I was also extremely close to my late grandmother. I thought that the portrayal of an elderly person feeling trapped by the limitations of their failing body (and sometimes their mind) was heart-wrenching yet spot-on. In your heart and your \\\"inner dialogue\\\" you don't feel any older than you did 60+ years ago, yet everything about your physical being has changed and the world around you has changed as well.The atmosphere and the feel of the book was wonderful. I felt like I was riding in that train car along with Jacob and Walter.  I felt the hurt that Jacob felt when he was orphaned, confused and lost.  I felt scared and anxious along with them, fearing that their \\\"stowaway\\\" in their car would be found.  I felt the elephant's fear and happiness.  I could almost hear the sounds of the circus, smell the peanuts and greasy food.The only thing I wasn't 100% convinced on was the relationship between Jacob and Marlena.  I felt it from Jacob, but not really from Marlena.  I felt like she was a weak character and there were moments I actually wondered if she gravitated towards Jacob because August was so cruel and hard to live with.  That is honestly the only negative thing I can say about this story.I think if you are looking for a real romantic read (like a Nicholas Sparks novel), I wouldn't recommend this. It has moments of romance but I didn't feel that was the main storyline. I got more out of it from the circus standpoint and the old man/young man's life.  I will be interested to see how \\\"romantic\\\" they make the movie (I am guessing by the poster, commercials and lead actors that it will be the main point of the movie).

After a few friends read, they assured me that I would be able to handle it, so I added it to the reading list for a class I am teaching this summer.  Boy, am I glad that I did!Part of this book is set in a nursing home, where an elderly Jacob is living and waiting for his famiy to visit so they can bring him to the circus.  The majority of this book is set in a circus, a second rate circus who really wants to be Ringling Bros.  Jacob joins the circus and is considered their vet, even though he does not have his official degree from Cornell.  He meets the circus folk and instantly forms a love/hate relationship with August and an attraction relationship with August's wife, Marlena.Circus life is not easy and this book shows it.  Animals are treated as property and receive basic, minimum care.  There is a huge class distinction between workers and performers.  Money is given out in order of the caste system.  There are nice people like Walter, Earl and Greg.  There are evil people like Uncle Al.  The most despicable character in this book is August.  He abused his wife, his animals and his workers.  I was hoping for justice and felt satisfied with how August ends up.There is also some not so dark relationships in this book. Jacob and Marlena share a deep connection and they spend time together, even though it is forbidden.  Walter loves his dog Queenie.  Jacob has a connection with the animals, especially Bobo and Rosie.  Camel gets Jacob a job with the show.

Also, it's about an older man reflecting back on his life. That alone should seem to confuse someone, but it was done seamlessly. A couple chapters of back-story, how it was back in the 30s and a chapter or two as the older man. Doing it that way, you get a feel of different personalities of the same man. How he was sweet and nicer in his younger days and grew to a grumpy old man.What I liked about this book was reading about the circus life and the history aspect of it all. It's clearly shown that Sara did her research when it came to writing that time period. Things were so in detail, I felt as if I was there.However, some things seemed a bit much. At the end, when I was reading the Author's Notes about this book, it mentions all the things that happened in the story were inspired by real events. The thing is though, not all of them happened to every circus. It was a random circus here and there. She ended up throwing all of the together in this one circus which was just too much and overcrowded. I really didn't think there needed to be that much in there. It makes it unrealistic to have it all happen.Supposedly there was a romance between Jacob and Marlena but to be honest, I didn't see it. I don't see how she was in love with him and I don't see how he was in love with her. I expected something to show they loved one another, I expected to be happy about it, but I was just lost and confused. It wasn't until Jacob kissed her that I realized that there was supposed to be a romance blooming there. I think it was then, about halfway through the book, that Sara realized she didn't have the romance in there and had to throw it in. It was stiff and unnatural. I like smiling at a romance that blossoms. I didn't smile.It honestly felt like they just \\\"liked\\\" each other because they both didn't like August, Marlena's husband. That's not enough of a reason to \\\"fall in love\\\". Or to cheat on your husband.There were a couple \\\"mature\\\" scenes in there. Two scenes were more sex related, though Sara doesn't go into too much detail about that. Well, yes and no. The first one is when Jacob is treated to a little something by the circus... slut. There were some details in there, which I skipped. I just was not into reading that. Sorry.The second one was with Marlena which was just a simple, they were in bed together. The fact that one is more detailed while the other is not is a bit confusing. The first one, Jacob was drunk and didn't know much of anything going on, yet he described things so well. Yet the second one, which was with the one whom he LOVED, was a simple line. There were no details, nothing. I thought if it was going to be with someone you loved, you would go into more detail than one curious drunken fling.Which was another issue with this book. The details weren't spread out enough in this. Some places it would be too much, while other places there wouldn't be enough. There was no balance in things.There was a good amount of language in here as well. I don't really find the need to have so many words in there cuss words. Especially to have the F word in there so many times. It was always F--- this, F--- that throughout, which I wasn't crazy about.Though, what I did enjoy was the fact that Sara wrote a male's POV though she is female. I honestly didn't know a woman wrote this until the end. I thought it was a man, due to some of the things that were written. I must say she did a male's pov very well.Would I recommend this book? Maybe.

Against that backdrop, I was very moved by this book, especially by the parts where the old man was narrating. I loved the spirited way he interacted with his nurses and the other residents, and his inner dialogue as he grudgingly allowed himself to be taken care of. It reminded me so much of the things we would see when we would visit PopPop; it made me wish I had more time to give to my relative before he passed away. I also loved how the narrator's voice sounded old-fashioned in the context of the modern day scenes, yet somehow contemporary in his flashback scenes. Kudos to the author for doing such a nice job with character voice.The plot was fun too- a young man trained as a vet hops a circus train and joins the crew. He falls in love with one of the show girls, who happens to be married to the lead trainer. Conflict ensues, and somewhere along the line an elephant appears. (Personally, I felt the elephant could have been given an even larger role; she was wonderful to read about.)The plot is simple enough; will he get the girl, or will she stay with her husband? My one complaint is that some of the examples the author gave on why the husband wasn't a model citizen weren't all that horrible in my mind. Yes, he does some appalling things, but one of his supposed despicable decisions was... well.... practical, in my mind. Maybe I'm just a cold-hearted monster, but you'll see what I mean when you read the book.Also, I felt the 'twist' at the end of the book was more akin to a 'trick' as readers are deliberately misled by the subtle revision of a key scene, but I am willing to overlook it given the pleasure I received from the book overall.A word of warning to parents of pre-teens who may want to read this book because of the movie that just came out: Descriptions of masturbation, strip teases, and sexual encounters all make appearances in this book. As a mother, I would recommend previewing these sections and taking your pre-teen's maturity level into consideration before giving them the book. It's all fairly tame, but it is mentioned.

This reader likes stories, and the author either created or embellished great stories of circus folklore [reader Author's Note at end].And, amid the story there is a common group of guys who are the comedy which hold the story together - otherwise it may be too depressing and too violent for some readers. The three eclectic characters are the foul-mouthed hard-tempered dwarf clown whose mother sold him to the circus, combined with the protagonist - a Cornell educated veterinarian, protagonist Jacob Jankowski., who falls into emotionally hard times -  and the old man of the circus family whose overindulgence of jake makes him become a victim of the paralyzing Jake Walk Effect, as him limbs wither along with his mind from the chemical's destructive forces. Each with his emotional or physical scars, enlightens the others with dry wit and warm compassion as each struggles to continue to live on the circus train where many mornings are greeted with discoveries of losses of others from \\\"red lightings\\\" -  those who are not economically valuable to the \\\"family\\\" are thrown off the train while in transit at the latest of hours.Amid many stereotypical characters - aren't most circus characters stereoptyped by this time? - is the greatest monster of them all: a paranoid schizophrenic Jew named August. A love triangle grows between August, his lovely wife Marlena and Jacob. Things get out of hand and at one time the author has Jacob think, \\\"It occurs to me that my conscience stopped me from killing August at the very moment someone was attempting to carry out his orders to kill me.\\\" \\\"Prizzi's Honor\\\" meets the big top.If there is any criticism of this book, it is not anything extraordinary.

Just not great.I also take my hat off to her delivery of the story through a young man's eyes.

A student in Cornell University, in Veterinary School, his parents are killed in an accident.  Jacob drops out of school, unable to pay his way.  In his own world of sadness, he comes across a wacky, dangerous group of circus folk, who call themselves the Benzini Bros.  Jacob lands himself a position as a veterinarian.  We emotionally become entangled in Jacob's downward spiral and passionately wish him to find his way through these, well written, but dangerous group of people.  We watch as he hits his lowests points.  We see him hit poverty, then beaten, crying, bleeding, loved and even see him drunk and hungover.  He is truly a rarity in the literary world, and when I finished this book I felt as if I made a friend.  My favorite character is Rosie, a deeply loving, horribly abused elephant.

Now this is a good book! Immediately engrossed, I had a hard time putting it down as I read the story of Jacob Jankowski and his reminiscence of days with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth--otherwise known as a train circus in 1930's America.A talented writer and storyteller, Sara Gruen takes readers on a bumpy and tense train ride through history. This tale defines Americana. There is no evidence of author here--simply narrator telling the story from Jacob's perspective (is he 91 or 93 years old?). I liked everything about the book, but primarily it was the crafting I liked best about this reading experience.Seamlessly, Gruen weaves together the modern day voice of this old man, a Cornell-educated veterinarian, abandoned in a nursing home--a.k.a. assisted living facility--and his memories of three months spent as the accidental veterinarian on a traveling circus. Just before his final exams, he learns his parents have been killed in a car accident and this is what sets the story in motion. Once he hops aboard a train, which he soon learns is a circus train, he falls in love with a pink-sequined performer, Marlena, and battles her schizophrenic husband, August, who happens to be his boss. Jacob, a sensitive and innocent soul, is highly likeable and befriends most of the animals aboard. Most unforgettably is a \\\"Polish\\\" elephant by the name of Rosie. But he also endears himself to his roommate, a dwarf named Walter, and a stowaway named Camel. One can't help but root for Jacob through the entire story.

Honestly though with all the newly discovered titles, authors, backlists, series, etc I fear I'll never get to revisit my beloveds anytime soon. But when (and if) that day comes, Water for Elephants will be on that list!I've never really been a big circus fan - reading about them or attending them, but I liked the atmosphere of circus life of the 1930s. It is both beautiful and gritty in detail. After reading this I must read more Great Depression era books. I can't imagine how hard it was to live in that time period and I find it fascinating and frightening.Bouncing between young and old Jacob's POV was actually a great way to read the novel. I felt as if I was re-living Jacob's memories as he did, rather than being told a story.  Jacob is utterly honest and humble as a young man and it's hard not to like his character. Harsh reality is thrust upon him after he tragically loses his parents and is forced to find a way to survive without money or family. Normal life is hard but living life under the famous Benzini Brothers' big top is even harder. Despite elderly Jacob being extremely (and understandably) cranky (I probably wouldn't want to be around him - family or not) Gruen does a spectacular job portraying his life and state of mind at the assisted living facility.Gruen actually does a spectacular job at a lot of things. She delivers a cast of characters that become just as important to me as Jacob, Marlena, and even Rosie, the larger-than-life elephant that is supposed to save the Benzini Brothers show from biting the dust. The characters are really the hands-down winner for me in this story. But it certainly was coupled with some amazing story-telling.I think I didn't give this one a solid 5 stars because the ending didn't quite sit well with me. While I'm glad of the outcome for Jacob I felt the HEA was sort of - slapped on, for lack of a better term. Kind of like \\\"Come on, let's hurry and wrap it up here\\\" ending...if that makes sense. It's happy (which made me happy; I happen to really like Jacob). Maybe a little too convenient for my tastes though. However, I have a hunch that if the ending were any different I'd still have a problem with it. Maybe I just didn't want Jacob's story to end *shrugs* ...Definitely a good thing about a book, if you ask me!As a side note I have not seen the movie adaptation but I want to.

There were no strict enforcements on labor law or even animal laws such as PETA back then. This was life; workers and performers thought of it as such. It is unpleasant to read and even learn about but it was a different time and a different world. Just like other tragic times in history (wars, genocides, slavery, etc.). As for the volgar parts, like the sexual scenes, just part of life back then too and I suppose Ms. Gruen wanted it to be properly formatted.This book is very descriptive, and emotional, has an excellent plot and an unexpected ending. This was unlike any other endings to be honest, and I was shocked and pleased with it. The pauses between young Jacob and old Jacob got me too, just because I feel sorry for old Jacob and happy he's able to go back to an important time to him. Got you thinking about the people in those situations who have nobody left and feel like a burden to your family just to come visit.If you are looking for a love story, happy ending and action book, this book is for you! :) Five stars!\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Water for Elephants\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1318118400, \"reviewTime\": \"10 9, 2011\"}\n",

Not only has he just tragically lost both of his parents, but thanks to the bank he is now broke, and homeless. Unclear as to what to do next Jacob starts walking, unfortunately a few hours later he realizes he is lost and his feet are covered in blisters. In short... he's no better off than when he started, but... all of that is about to change when he hears a train is coming his way.  With no clue as to where he is, or where to go next, Jacob makes a decision; hop the train and see where it takes him, little did he know that that would be the circus. Finding himself knee deep in the Benzini Brother's most spectacular show on Earth; Jacob quickly discovers that his \\\"previous\\\" life may (in fact) do him justice in his \\\"new\\\" one, and takes on a job as the circus' official veterinarian. With animals however, comes their performers and that's where things start to get sticky. Marlena is beautiful, kind, smart, and more importantly... taken. Will Jacob be able to control his feelings for the one person he is forbidden from caring about? Why and how are people disappearing off of the train, and what REALLY happened that fateful day when the world flipped upside down and all hell broke loose?Gruen is very clearly a masterful storyteller.  Not only did she deliver a gasp worthy love story, but the background in which her story took place was so artfully crafted that after only 1 chapter I found it impossible to put down.  The detail involved in creating the grit of a traveling circus (while at the same time tacking such issues as the Great Depression and Prohibition) was genius, and to do it through the eyes of 1 man at very different times in his life (23 and 90 or 93) added a depth and emotional connection that would have otherwise been lost if penned differently. The story as a whole was perfectly plotted, leaving zero downtime for the readers mind to wonder off or lose focus of the moral dilemmas at hand, and at the end of the day became: just another one of those books that sucks you in and doesn't let you go.Overall...a wonderful book and an interesting peek into classic American history.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: animals may not be able to talk to you, but they can understand you.

I'm aware I'm in the minority, but I can't honestly say I enjoyed this book.  It was very predictable, and the characters were wooden.  Marlena has zero depth--and Joseph isn't much better.  They fall in love, but it seems more like the affair happens because the author wrote it into the plot, not because these were two developed, real people whose minds and hearts shared something magical.  A few of the secondary characters have more detail, but they never go beyond superficial personality traits.The elephant is the absolute best part, and once I read that Gruen was inspired by old stories and photographs of real circus elephants and performers, I wished she'd gone ahead and written a non-fiction book so she could really delve into the struggle of the era and the horrible treatment of these animals.  She makes aspects of the circus interesting--in fact, that's why I kept reading even after I'd given up on the story having any real complexity or resonance, but the whole book is littered with anachronistic language that disturbs the realism she's aiming for.She's trying to get at some very deep issues (mental illness, extra-marital affairs, spousal abuse, the traumas of the Great Depression) but it's all very superficial.  She never quite digs deep enough to give these real complexity or power, so all of the characters have very obvious, stereotypical, predictably shallow reactions to these deep issues, and I was left feeling a bit like I was reading a kid's slightly juvenile interpretation of events.  Overall, disappointing and even a little simplistic.

This book was a departure for me, one that I took on the faith of the 1600+ positive reviews.  Those reviews misled me, I'm afraid.It's mystifying why so many reviewers loved this book.  It's not a bad story, a fairly straightforward narrative without any literary flourishes, written in plain language and present tense. Certainly the author did her research so she could use the right lingo and details.  Flash-forwards to the protagonist's current life in a nursing home only provide a pretense for the ending, unfortunately.  The plot is so thin that until about 3/4ths of the way through, I was convinced there wasn't one.  Likewise, the characters are fairly thinly realized, except for the \\\"paranoid schizophrenic\\\" villain and the intelligent elephant, Rosie.  I found myself wondering why I even liked the protagonist, who fashioned himself as a kind of savior for a couple of victimized lesser players.  Recently bereaved, the protagonist's experience of bereavement is completely absent from the book, which I found unrealistic at best.That said, I was surprised that I stuck it out and read to the end, which is why I didn't give the book a lower rating.  In all honesty, the last quarter of the book is quite possibly the best, when the main character finally acts on all his misguided desires. However, the final scene disappointed me; it seemed a bit too contrived.Light reading, this one.

Also, I scanned a few 1- and 2-star reviews before I read the book, to see what some people didn't like, so some of my review is addressing others' opinions.First, the narrators for the audio book I thought did a pretty good job. The young Jacob did a wonderful job using varying voices for the various circus people and I forgot they were all spoken by the same person. The old Jacob's voice was great for a crotchety old man, but still clear enough to understand. 4 out of 5 stars for narration.I thought the story overall was good. I did not feel as much of a connection to the characters as I would have liked and that may be due to the \\\"shallow\\\" writing that some people have complained about in reviews. I did laugh out loud in the car listening to some of the narration by the \\\"old Jacob\\\" though, I thought his character was amusing.I don't claim to know much of anything factual about the early 20th century or life in the circus (then or now) for that matter. With that said, I thought the descriptions of this FICTIONAL circus and recent college graduate veterinarian were nicely done. I felt like I understood what the narrator was talking about and how he was feeling (most of the time).Yes, there was some animal cruelty and there was some sex/masturbation. While I don't particularly enjoy reading about animals being hurt or neglected, I felt that the things they were doing seemed as if they might have been done during that time period due to desperation/ignorance or that was just what everyone else did. As for the sex/masturbation, again, I don't generally enjoy reading those things, but I thought they might have been appropriate for the time and characters.  How else is a little person going to get physical pleasure in a time before \\\"political correctness\\\" where his mother SOLD him to the circus to be a circus freak/clown because of his stature?  The sex between the characters was inevitable and if someone is so offended by it that they quit the book, maybe they should go back to reading Dick and Jane (unless you're also offended by the word/name Dick).Overall, I enjoyed the story. Interesting time period, good characters, and good narration from two different perspectives of the same character. I've never read any books about the circus and after reading this one, I might have to find some others.

I knew it was about a circus, and obviously for the title, an elephant was involved.  What I was not prepared for however, was the cruelty it showed.  And I don't doubt for a minute, that even though this was fiction, that these atrocities didn't happen in real circuses.We are introduced to a death in the prologue.  While it is fuzzy and hard to tell who's who, we are witnesses to a scene that the narrator, Jacob, has viewed and never forgotten. Mayhem abounds as we discover that the menagerie of a circus is on the stampede.We are then reintroduced to Jacob, many years later, as he is a resident at a nursing home.  He is ninety three, or ninety one, he can't keep it straight and a circus is in town and being set up within sight of the nursing home.  This causes him to reminisce about his time spent with the Benzini Brothers circus.As a runaway college student, after the death of his parents, he finds himself hopping a train that turns out to be part of the circus train.  There, instead of being thrown off, he is taken in by an older man named Camel who secures him a job with the circus mucking stalls, which later turns into a position as the circus's veterinarian.He falls in love with Marlena, the wife of his schizophrenic boss August.  While he keeps his love hidden, August, dangerous and unpredictable makes life tough for Jacob in the circus while in his better moments is a best friend to him.He also makes the acquaintance of Walter, a dwarf clown whom he bunks with and together they help Camel in his time of need.  He also makes an unlikely friend in Rosie, an elephant picked up from another failing circus whom he feels a bond with and devastation at her treatment from the cruel August.Throughout the book it cuts back and forth from Jacob at the nursing home, to his reminisces of the circus and its happenings.  One of the ending chapters recaps the prologue, only with more detail.Gruen does such a marvelous job on this book that you would believe she had traveled with a circus.  But she hadn't, all her knowledge came form extensive research and interviews.  The result is this novel, gritty and real and it keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen.  Jacob's tale is one I could read over and over again.  By far this turned out to be one of my favorite books.  And the ending, well in hopes to get you reading this book, the ending was perfect and real fitting for such a wonderful tale.

Quite simply, I found Water for Elephants an exceptional read and one that any reader should not miss. Briefly the novel is during the Depression in the USA and it recalls how a circus struggles to survive. The story is seen from the eyes of Jacob Jankowski, an unqualified vet who jumped on the Benzini Brothers circus train, one evening after the shocking death of his parents.The action in Water for Elephants is just right; more than sufficiently paced to keep the reader glued to the pages. There are flashbacks reverting back to the nursing home of the present-day, where Jacob is finding his aged infirmity unbearable, but somehow this only adds to the depth of the story.Sara Gruen has created a circus world that's believable; one that you feel right in the midst of and this is carried through with her characters.  Uncle Al, (the circus boss) and August, (the animal trainer) are characters you'll hate. Whereas Marlena, Kinko the Dwarf, and Camel are character's you'll love. Chief protagonist is Jacob Jankowski and I found myself completely empathising with him. His struggle to fit into circus life, gain acceptance from his peers and deal with the urges of his love interest, make him a hugely engaging character.I highly recommend this book. It's a gripping story and is one of those novels which will both shock and thrill you. The stark poverty of the early nineteen hundreds is interspersed with details of the emotional deprivation the main character, Jacob experiences in a nursing home during his latter years. Yet in both settings a light is shone on acts of kindness which define our humanity and reinforce the fragile dignity of those who are almost overwhelmed by their plights. There is a social history dimension to the story which enhances its value and impact.

He decides to hop a train and ends up in the middle of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  The Great Depression was just in its early stages so for Jacob having a paying job was lucky but he also found parts of the circus life to be a living hell.  As he was just shy of his degree, Jacob ends up being put in charge of the menagerie, the starring animals of the show.He then meets Marlena, the beautiful equestrian act star who happens to be married to August, the twisted and manipulative animal trainer for the show.Uncle Al, the big boss of the Benzini Brothers, makes a habit of visiting other circus shows that fold and go under.  There he has his pick of their performers and animals.  It is at one such place that he picks up Rose, an untrainable elephant.  He hopes her to be the savior of this traveling show that struggles a bit to keep up with Ringling Brothers, the top of the line.  Jacob finds an instant connection with Rosie and the show and his life start to change.The book alternates between Jacobs time with the circus and his \\\"present\\\" time where he is 90 (\\\"or maybe 93\\\"...as he can't quite remember) and in an assisted living home.  A circus has come to town and is visible out of the windows of the home.  No one knows Jacobs past at the home when a new resident comes along and claims he carried water for the elephants in the circus when he was younger.  This kind of woos the ladies and makes Jacob (who is much the curmudgeon by this time in his life) very upset and sets off a string of trouble for him at the home.The prologue when read at the beginning of the book very much drew me in to the story.  When the same story makes its appearance toward the end of the book it is amazingly powerful.  You'll just have to read it for yourself to truly see what I'm talking about.You can really tell that the author has a love of the circus and has done her research to bring the most accuracy she can to this tale.  I honestly thought when I heard about this book from everyone that it was really not my cup of tea.  I'm not one to just read love stories...I have to have some kind of conflict or suspense or something along those lines to keep my interest.  That being said, this book does not lack for anything.

Why did he join the circus in the first place? Not once did he mention missing his dead parents, his home, school etc. Didn't he have any memories from his childhood, no worries about the future, no relatives, no friends? You never knew what he was about to do next, because his motives, thoughts and emotions were never dealt with, and that's probably because the writer had absolutely no idea how to do that properly.3) I get the feeling that some people liked this book simply because it was so easy to read even Bobo the monkey would get it, since it lacked any depth or complication in the script or the characters. Readers who rate this kind of books with 5 stars have obviously no idea what real literature is.4) The dialogue was poor, and so blatantly contemporary that it made me angry at the writer's lazyness of doing her research properly.5) It was so obvious that the writer was a woman that you could not get it out of your mind even for a minute.6) I'm no prude, but I'm sure images of the masturbating dwarf will be haunting me for a long time.7) Trust a good old disaster/great accident to get rid of the bad guys for you. That way you don't get to kill them yourself and become (gasp!) a bad guy yourself. I would be curious to see how the main character would get out of all that mess if the stampede had not happened.8) If you owned a circus and half a brain, would you hire a 90 year old cripple whith serious health problems who ran away from a nursing home and whom you have just met? Yeah, I didn't think so.9) I can't really recall the sex scenes, which means they we probably not as graphic as some readers suggest, and as for the animal cruelty parts of the novel, yes, they were (theoretically) gruesome but failed to disturb me or make a real impression on me because they were simply not convincing or believable, as was the rest of the book.\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"summary\": \"reads like a script from a bad Disney movie\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1276560000, \"reviewTime\": \"06 15, 2010\"}\n",

Jacob, a 93-year-old man living in a nursing home, recalls his stint as a vet on a traveling circus during the 1930s. As a young vet student at Cornell, Jacob is just about to sit for his final exams when both of his parents are killed in a car wreck. Sorting through their affairs, Jacob discovers that his family was penniless, having mortgaged their home to pay for his Ivy-league education.Sick with grief, Jacob hops a train. A train, he discovers, that is carrying the Benzini Brothers traveling circus. Before he knows it, he's on staff as the circus vet, tending to the needs of the circus lions, chimpanzees, and other fauna. It doesn't take Jacob long to meet Marlena, the beautiful performer in charge of the trick horses, and he's instantly smitten. However, Marlena's not free; she's already married to August, a bipolar, abusive manager in the traveling outfit. (Hence the requisite love triangle.)The rest of the tale follows Jacob as he discovers Rosie, a talented performing elephant; finds his own voice; siezes true love; and makes his way in the world.This is a great book. It's entertaining and easy to read, but not so rote and predictable that you don't get a kick out of it. Details of circus life in the 1930s are colorful and rich.

Quite honestly, the goodreads synopses does the book no justice because what this book is-is no less than amazing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but mine happens to be that this is one of my all time favorite books. My compairison to the movie almost ruined the book for me, but I'm glad that I was able to get past it.The beginning of the book is very misleading, and it really made me dislike Marlena, the leading lady of this books. It is Marlena who begins an affair with Jacob, our hero, only they don't sleep together until its already been assumed by other people that they were indeed together. I did not like her one bit until the end.One of the most charming aspects of this book is how it flips between young Jacob as he works on the circus with the animals and then back again to him, 90 or 93 (he's not quite sure). I thought that the switch between the two worlds is great because on one side you see this young man who has his whole life ahead of him and then you see where he is today.I loved when he talked about the animals and how he took care of them. Once he mentioned that he was a vet student, you can tell that he is going to work in the capacity of vet to the animals. I hated how the animals were mistreated by August, especially Rosie, who was the lovable elephant. Although Rosie seems stupid, she proves to be a lot smarter than anyone thought.Most of the characters have redeeming qualities that, although they are rough around the edges, you can't help but feel for them. Walter and Camel, Jacob's two bunkmates are no exception to that characterization. Walter- a midget clown and his dog Queenie, are very mean at the start until a prank makes Water soften up on the new guy. Camel was the one that helped to get Jacob a job on the circus to begin with.What made the book for me was also the ending, and although you can interpret it two ways, I chose to see it as an old man who isn't ready to settle down into a nursing home and so instead he moves forward with his life on board with another circus.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"A new favorite\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1346544000, \"reviewTime\": \"09 2, 2012\"}\n",

I understood that, while the story was fiction, the author did some research and incorporated several real-life incidents. So, based on this, I actually crossed the threshold of a physical Barnes & Noble, picked \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" off a wooden shelf, and presented my plastic card to a human cashier. For all this effort, I truly hoped the novel would be superb. In some ways, it was.  But overall, no.\\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is the story of the struggling Benzini Brothers circus, for which the main character and narrator, Jacob Jankowski, works as a veterinarian. Jacob falls in love with Marlena, a kind and beautiful performer. Unfortunately, Marlena is married to the violently temperamental animal trainer, August. When the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob and Marlena struggle together to defend the sweet pachyderm against August's rages. The story divulges the slimy underbelly of circus life, including gross mistreatment of both human workers and animals, right up to the stunning climax when Marlena ends August's reign of terror.Gruen alternates the novel's setting between a contemporary nursing home where 93-year-old Jacob now lives in a state of semi-dementia, and the 1931 traveling circus. In the nursing home, as Jacob waits for his family to escort him to a modern circus, he wafts in and out of lucidity and mentally revisits his old Benzini Brothers days. Although the flashback technique feels a little worn and, in Gruen's hands, contrived, it does set up a finely constructed and sentimental ending, which is one of the novel's strengths.Aside from the tender conclusion, the story itself has other redeeming qualities. The plot is engaging enough to keep you reading, especially as it nears the climax. Also, Gruen exposes the abuses that occurred in depression-era circuses and, which I fear, probably still exist to some extent. Several scenes are emotionally excruciating, but responsible consumers should be aware of ugly realities.Unfortunately, \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" also disappoints.  First, the characters are shallowly constructed. I didn't walk away with a lasting identification with any of them, and in fact, by the time I wrote this post, I had to look up all of their names. Also, Gruen's writing style is flat and unmemorable. While the premise was promising, her blas&eacute; rendering diminished what might have been a great novel in the hands of a more skilled wordsmith.If you care about animals, you want a good story, and you're not a finicky reader, then step right up! \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" will entertain and amaze, and it may even spur you to reconsider your attitude toward traveling animal shows. But if you're hungry for something profound and beautiful, then move along, folks.

The pace of the plot and the use of flashbacks work very well and speed things smoothly along.  The sensitivity between nursing home resident Jacob and favorite nurse Rosemary is beautifully portrayed, and Jacob's observations in the nursing home seem right on target.Minuses: (1) Not enough solid background research into the psyche of the lead character (Jacob) as an almost-veterinarian (moreover, he is also son of a veterinarian).  There were passages where his feelings for and about animals were almost entirely ignored.  In general, there would have been more solid creativity if the author had explored and deepened the relationship of the vet with the animals.  I was expecting Jacob to develop a very deep understanding of at least the elephant, leading to a very strong bond, etc.  He goes through the motions, but I never believe he really understands the elephant, and this is one of the most important parts of the story.(2) Conversely, too much attention is given the run-of-the-mill sexual awakening and human love story of the main character.  I don't mind that it's part of the novel, but I was expecting a deep, enchanting bond between human and animals, which would set the novel apart from the ho-hum.  For me, this borders on a Romance Novel, and should be advertised as such.(3) There was just barely enough information about the circus to hold the story up, and there could have been richer texture by beefing up the details about circus life.Summary: If you happen to have read Waller's -The Bridges of Madison County-(another book that caused a big stir, even though it was basically a romance novel), as well as a perfect gem of a book called -Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe- (Fannie Flagg's masterpiece that was almost as good on film) and if you've read Berger's -Little Big Man- one of the most creative uses of the flashbacks of an very aged man (not so good on film)...put these 3 together and you can imagine what -Water for Elephants- is like.Better yet, if you haven't read Fried Green Tomatoes or Little Big Man, GO READ THOSE INSTEAD of Water for Elephants.

This is one rare occasion where I loved the movie more than the book (but that may just be because I saw the movie first.) In some ways this is like an amped up romance novel.

Only after subsequent prompting from my friend did I agree to give it a shot. That turned out to be an EXCELLENT idea. It was clear and concise reading that gave me vivid images of that era and written with short chapters that propelled me along to read just a little more each time since I was skeptical from the start. The story recounted through the eyes of an old man reminiscing his youth was pulled off seamlessly. It was like reading two stories.

Love between a man and a woman; love between humans and animals; and people's love of circuses. All these sub-stories coalesce into one that is set at the time of the Great Depression to make up the background of this book.The book starts with a horrendous scene in which the circus's animals stampede and a murder takes place. A man's head is split open by a big stake. The next chapter is in the nursing home where we get to meet a 90+ year old man named Jacob who is in a nursing home. Jacob is lucid and his mind is still sharp and he comments on the other residents of the nursing home who are much further along the path of dementia and senility. The rest of the book bounces around between Jacob in the nursing home, and Jacob as the brand-new minted veterinarian.Putting the story in a time line, Jacob is about set to graduate from the Cornell Veterinary School when a tragic accident kills his parents. He is an only child and it turns out that his parents took all of their savings and a mortgage out on their house to be able to afford to send him to Cornell. When they die, there is nothing left for him so he returns to Cornell to sit for his final exams. His mind is not on schooling and he ends up leaving the school and wanders down the road. It's not long before he decides to hop on a train that is travelling by and this gets him introduced into the world of the circus as it just happens to be a circus train that he jumps on.Being the time of the Great Depression, there is a chance that he will get thrown directly off the train as a hobo but he manages to make some friends among the crowd of laborers and they get him accepted as another laborer on the circus until it is discovered that he is almost a veterinarian. For the circus owner, that is close enough and Jacob is now the circus's vet. Now he moves up in the world and is allowed to travel in a train car with performers and meets the love of his life amongst them. He also meets up with animals that he treats with empathy and kindness - and they respond with friendship.He also meets with some of the more zany and crazy people who inhabit that world and none of them are necessarily nice. There is a crazy horse trainer; violent security men; \\\"patch men\\\" who clean up the inevitable problems and messes that take place; and, of course, the associated laborers and hangers-on who populate the world. Jacob deals with them all in his own way and the story develops in a relatively predictable manner. It is no surprise that the animals respond to Jacob's kindness in kind and find ways to get back at the people who treat them badly. There are numerous anecdotes sprinkled throughout the book culled from the rich history of the circus world - things like the Lemonade Thief; the Animal who only understands Polish; and the less than legal activities that surrounded the circus.The climax of the story is presented in the first chapter - the murder. There is no real mystery there - we know who will get murdered right after the first meeting with the man. What is left in doubt is who did the killing. That is resolved in a very satisfying way at the end of the book.However, there is another storyline here too. The old Jacob finds out that a circus is coming to perform outside his nursing home and he would dearly like to go back to the world that he left 60-odd years before - if only for a visit. But, wouldn't you know it - that happens to be the week that his family forgets to come visit him in the nursing home. The twist that the author puts in at this point is brilliant and brings the whole book to a double satisfying ending which proves that once you are involved in a world that you really like, you never really leave it.This was overall a very fun book to read. Being an animal lover, I really appreciated the insights into the world of the exotic - and not so exotic - animals provided. Of course, the whole glimpse into the world of circus life was also interesting. About the only negative thing I have to say about the book is its almost obsessive fascination with human sexuality. There is almost no single chapter that does not have a sex scene in it and it is not clear to me how most of them contribute to the overall story line. In other words, I would not give this story to your younger children to read, but, aside from that one quibble, this is a good read.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"True loves can be found in the circus\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1221264000, \"reviewTime\": \"09 13, 2008\"}\n",

I picked it up and the prologue had a pretty decent umph to it.  The plot, a cornell student in his senior year, loses his parents and joins the circus in a fit of anger and disbelief, is told to the reader soon after the book starts.  The rest of the book is told through the eyes of the boy, Jacob as a young man in the circus and simultaneously as an old man in a home.The story is a bit strange, yet it works.  I have to admit that some of the character development was not great but it seems that mysterious part of the story was intentional.  The book is about Jacob, and his experiences.  The other characters were just there to help us understand this man.The part of the book I thought I would like the least, animals, I tended to enjoy quite often.  And Sara's soft writing style but quick with the action kept me on the edge of my seat.  As soon as I thought the story was taking a long, boring, un-necessary mistep to fill empty book pages, she surprised me with another turn in the story.  I enjoyed her writing style.  She had a story to tell, and she told it.  She didn't bore us with endless details of animal cages, circus scenes, or odd scenic descriptions.  In fact, ironically, I found myself wanting a little more time with some of the animals.  At the end of the book I thought maybe she could have wrote a few more in-depth scenes with jacob interacting with the animals.  But like I said, this is a story about a boys emotional journey through a very difficult time in his life.  The animals and the other characters in the book just provided a backdrop and an interesting environment.Note:  Although, I see the book as a book about Jacob, Sara was inspired to write this novel after reading an article about the Circus.  She then spent some time researching the circus and animals intending to write a story about the circus.  Interestingly enough, maybe she wrote a story about the circus and Jacob is just the human backdrop!  I do highly recommend this book.

LOL. I loved the book so much I'm try not to let myself give too much away!**My Description:Water for Elephants is a novel bringing us back to the world of the traveling circus in the early 1900&#8242;s when they traveled by train.  Jacob Jankowski is a young man in his early 20&#8242;s with dreams of becoming a veterinarian like his father.  Very close to the final day for his testing to become licensed his parents die in a car accident and his entire life changes.  Running away from his problems he ends up jumping on a train and this one-act takes him on the ride of his life.  Jacob becomes a worker for a traveling circus as their very own vet and in the process falls in love with Marlena, one of the shows acts.  The problem, she's a married woman.  Along their travels the circus owner buys an Elephant, Rosie, in hopes to become the greatest act in all the history of circuses...Water for Elephants is a magical book! It brought me back to when I was a child dreaming of being a circus performer.  The way Gruen describes the circus and it's acts really paints a picture in your mind and you feel like you are right there with Jacob the entire time.  I loved how Gruen cuts back and forth between Jacob as an elderly man in a home remembering when he was on a circus to when Jacob was in his early 20&#8242;s on the circus.  You love Jacob in both ages, especially as a  feisty elderly man! I love when Gruen brought Jacob in as an elderly man, he brings in some comedy as well as makes you understand how some elderly people feel when they are in a nursing home.Gruen knows how to writer her characters.  You fall in love with so many of them!  Walter, Jacob's roommate on the train. Camel, the man who takes Jacob in under his wing when Jacob first jumps on the train.  The lovely Marlena, Jacobs love interest.  Rosie, the beautiful 53-year-old-elephant.  You also don't like some of the characters like Uncle Al, the circus owner, and August, Marlena's husband.  Trust me, there are times you just want to jump through the book and beat them yourselves!I absolutely fell in love with this book.  I had two of my good friends telling me that I must read it because it was just that good and I was not disappointed.  I do believe that anyone who has an interest in any genre would love this book!  It's a very fast read and you don't want to put it down. Again, it's just magical! It leaves you smiling and happy.  This book will be on my bookshelf forever and will be picked up several times for a reread! :-DOh, you can buy the Kindle version of this book for just a little over $4.00 but from what I've heard you don't get the awesome circus pictures throughout the book.  Gruen places a real circus picture at the beginning of each chapter that is from when Jacob is in his 20&#8242;s on the circus.  It's awesome! There is only one chapter that didn't have a circus pic infront of it when it should have, :-( but really they are great.  If you buy the kindle version, the next time you're in the bookstore pick up the paperback version and flip through and check out the pictures at least...they're fun!  :-D\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"6/5 Stars!

Bunkel, known as Uncle Al, who is described as \\\"a buzzard, a vulture, an eater of carrion,\\\" who grew fat off the carcasses of circusses that collapsed after the Crash. Their losses were his gains.  The Prologue introduces the narrative which begins with a stampede of circus animals, and we are introduced to a secret which is kept by the narrator for 70 years.  The reader is immediately pulled into the narrative.The narrative is juxtaposed between Jacob Jankowski's life during the seven years he spent in the circus and his present life as an irascible 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) year old man in an assisted living facility.  As a young  veterinary student about to graduate from Cornell, Jacob finds himself homeless and parentless and is unable to take his final exams.  He finds himself jumping on a train which turns out to be Benzini's Circus train.  The reader is introduced to circus lingo - rubes are the circus-goers, kinkers are the performers and Patches are the men assigned to smooth the ruffled feathers of disgruntled spectators who might be angry they didn't get their money's worth at the Freak Show or those of a homeowner whose garden has been destroyed by a wandering elephant. One is given a glimpse into the highly stratified, almost caste-like social world of the circus in which performers never rubbed elbows with the likes of the lowly workers, particulary the black workers of the Flying Squadron, who were instructed to run into their tents and remain invisible as soon as the rubes started to make their appearance.The novel is plot-driven, and although there are many stereotypical elements - there are the requisite evil villains - Uncle Al and his sidekick August Rosenbluth, the equestrian director and superintendent of animals who is hated and feared for his violent tendencies and his legendary cruelty to humans and circus animals. There is also the requisite central love story between two gentle souls sho have been dealt life's difficult blows, but whose goodness and pure intentions help them to weather the storm. There is Bobo the orangutuan and particularly Rosie the elephant, who steal our hearts, and we root for them as much as we root for Jacob and Marlena. If you are looking for a novel embedded with deep hidden meanings and rich with literary technique and complex characterization, then this is definitely not the book for you. If you are looking for a plot-driven novel whose events proceed rapidly and which transports the reader to another world, then I highly recommend this delightfully readable novel.In spite of the stereotypical elements, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I found myself getting up extra early and staying up extra late to get to the last page, and when I did, I was sorry the journey was over. I wasn't quite ready to say goodbye to Jacob, Marlena, Kinko, Camel, Rosie or Bobo.

The circus train theme is interesting and fun to read, and this is what keeps the book going. One scene near the end depicted the main characters in a church; I thought this would be developed further. It turns out this was just added in to try to show the morality of Jacob, perhaps to foreshadow that he could never kill Marlena's husband August. Jacob started out at the beginning of the book as a naive innocent kid. How he could change into such an experienced risk-taker in a period of just a few months confused me. He certainly doesn't seem the church-going type by the end of the novel.

Unfortunately for Jacob (our star) it was not his dream to join the circus, but rather coincidence mixed with his last hope. The story is told from two viewpoints: Jacob is now ninety-something years old and we see what has become of our young protagonist, and we see many flashback sequences to the events that took place as he traveled with the circus.As readers we are exposed to the sharp contrast between his youth and aged eras. With the circus, Jacob's life was so full of adventure and non-stop activity. Now he is resident in an assisted-living facility and he fears he is losing his energy and becoming more and more like the peers with whom he shares lodging. As he relives the excitement of his days with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth he not only longs for a different time, but resets his grip on his past. He is one old man who is not ready to give up on life.Sara Gruen gave us a beautiful story about a man who refuses to let go of the events that changed his life. As you read about Jacob your heart will break and then, if possible, it will break again. It is much more than one young man's tale of woe, however. The story is one of love, hope, never giving up and some unlikely good friends. You will laugh, worry, delight and cheer with Jacob whether he is twenty something or ninety something. I really appreciate that the author went the extra mile in her research of life in the circus.I didn't think I would like Water for Elephants, but I heard from too many people that it was good.

Petersen\", \"helpful\": [1, 1], \"reviewText\": \"Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is a creative delight.  She uses structure, plot, and setting with originality.  She employs literary devices in innovative ways.  Her characters are believable even though they inhabit the unreal world of the circus.First, structure and plot.  Gruen describes the ending of the novel in the prologue.  She infuses the prologue with ambiguity so the reader cannot be clear about what happened.  She structures the rest of the book as a search for answers to the perplexing prologue.Second, innovative literary devices.  Gruen withholds information like a magician.  This device (suspense) allows her to keep the reader engaged, and befuddled. The novel reads like the children's storytelling game where the narrator brings a character to an impossible situation then hands the storytelling over to the next person.  Each chapter has a rise and fall.Another literary device Gruen handles creatively is point of view.  The story, told in first person, is seen through the consciousness of Jacob Jankowski.  But Jacob's point of view is complicated because it alternates between Jacob in his twenties, and Jacob in his nineties.  So the reader sees two viewpoints depending upon which stage of life Jacob narrates his story from.Finally setting and characters.  Gruen's setting and characters are unusual.  The background is Midwestern, and depression-era.  The culture is the circus (Benzini's not-quite-as-good-as-Ringling-Bros Circus).  The characters are performers, entertainers, workers, and animals that perform, eat, sleep, travel, love, hate, fight, and care for each other with a common goal: to produce a show.  Though the setting and characters are specific, the reader can relate to them because they display the same passions and vulnerability we all do.  Gruen transcends specificity and finds universal connections.  Life is performing in the Big Top.  We are all players.  We struggle with good and evil, kindness and cruelty, pleasure and suffering, life and death.  The show goes on.  Sara Gruen writes with originality and soul.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Originality and Soul\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1199664000, \"reviewTime\": \"01 7, 2008\"}\n",

After failing to complete veterinary school, he ends up working on a traveling circus, going to town after town with the big top acts, the freak shows, and the menagerie of exotic animals.  He quickly learns that there is a darker side to the circus behind the scenes that the happy, popcorn eating crown never sees.The set up workers are considered expendable and are kicked off the train if they stay on past their usefulness, and animals are often treated cruelly and ruthlessly.  Out of necessity, sometimes life was cruel during the Great Depression, but sleazy ringmaster Uncle Al and violent animal trainer August Rosenbluth choose to perpetrate this unnecessarily at the Benzini Brothers circus.  Jacob remains part of this world as he is tied by love and duty to the animals in his care, as well as his friends and the beautiful Marlena, wife of August.This was not always an easy book to read.  There are graphic scenes of animal cruelty that had me wincing, as well as heartbreaking scenes of human disappointments and pain.  Despite this, I recommend this novel wholeheartedly.  Sara Gruen describes the scene perfectly, from the Great Depression to the atmosphere of the circus, and there are some uplifting messages about the powers of kindness and love for the reader to take away as well.

That changed moment can even make us think that what we wanted was not what we really wanted after all.As for the animal cruelty, while I hate it, I had to say that it really did occur and probably still does occur in some circuses. Very hard for me to stomach, but at least the author put the truth in the book.I am not going to summarize the book. All I can really say is pick it up and give it a try. A definite entertainment.

Which is really disappointing because the setting was great.

Unfortunately, the author didn't put this great source material to the best use.Don't get me wrong - I finished the book and finished it pretty quickly.

Sara Gruen did an amazing job with her research and the detail she outlined in the book.  She was able to find a perfect balance of grisly and romantic.  Gruen used that same \\\"memory sequence\\\" style of storytelling as The House at Riverton, Titanic, and Rebecca.  The flips from past to present were seamless.Gruen's depiction of the narrator as a 98 year old man was awesome.  She allowed the reader to understand the traumas of being \\\"that old\\\" as well as remind us there's often a pretty amazing story to most of the older generation.Each character had a function in the story, including the nursing home staff.  There were no superficial characters and every single character helped you to understand \\\"who\\\" the main character was.This was one of those fun reads that sucks you in and makes you wish the story could go on forever.

Part wonder, part adventure, part tragedy and turmoil, and part romance, my first Gruen novel conveys a novel artistry in the settings, characters, prose and storytelling that resonated. Similar to another I read recently (Cornwell's rendition of Arthur), we find a popular style of writing I find many authors choosing as of late: a first-person narration that shifts from a flashback when he's 23 years old and to the present tense when he's 90... or 93. The flashback comprises the bulk of the book's content over the span of 3 to 4 months when 23 year-old Jacob lands in a shady traveling circus amidst the historical backdrop of the Great Depression and the prohibition of alcohol. Normally, first-person flashbacks tend to affect a doleful disposition. Not so here. Remarkably, I found the present happenings of our senile 90-or-93 year-old Jacob in a nursing home refreshingly funny and instructively captivating as we laugh and empathize with Jacob. I'll never look at my grandmother the same way again. In fact the book derives its title from a grumpy Jacob grousing over another old man claiming to bring water for elephants in his younger days.Personal wants and simple plot devices prevented a perfect 5-star rating on my part. I'm impressed by Gruen's research into the time period and traveling circuses, and admittedly, Gruen's hypnotizing writing style, symmetric storytelling and gritty characterizations far surpasses many of my 4 and 5-star books. I read a 553-page large print edition of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS containing black-and-white photos of 1930s circuses and for the 100 to 200 pages, I was enthralled. The wonder and the adventure of it had me smiling and on the edge of my seat. The book then settles down with the August-Rosenbluth character who factors in more and more prominently. Much of the plotting deals with August, his wife Marlena and our protagonist Jacob as the third wheel at a private dinner or outing. August's violent schizophrenia took center stage and the August character and his prominence choked much of my enthusiasm. Instead of August, I was hoping for more wonders of the circus, more Camel, Walter, and more plots with the animals of the menagerie. The caste-like, hierarchal circus society consisting of performers, workers and rubes was very interesting, but Jacob's helplessness within that hierarchy, although gritty and realistic, proved altogether exasperating. I was hoping to see Jacob doing more, whether helping the elephant or protecting Marlena (both from August). I also found the ending a bit disappointing and anticlimactic, I wanted to see at least one more chapter of closure in the flashback rather than relaying the aftermath in the present tense.At its heart, the book expresses Jacob's story of love -- an impossible love for his wife, a love for animals and the elephant, and of course, a love for the wondrous circus. Unlike so many potboiler romance novels, here's a love between a man and woman that isn't so trite: we have a sexually-inexperienced, red-haired 23 year-old college boy and the compassionate star of the circus who dares to love him, and in return, warrants his affection, caring, loyalty and love. Even though their first love scene isn't ideal by romance standards, it nevertheless reverberates with passion and we witness Jacob's joy for giving as she guides him. Granted, it's written entirely from Jacob's perspective and even though the first lovemaking wasn't scientifically precise (again, by romance standards), the book captures how each gives their heart for the other. Everything isn't initiated by Jacob and that in itself was noteworthy. For myself, love is about mutual giving, and I always hope to see some semblance of that. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS doesn't disappoint.I'm astonished to read a very believable and resonating account of a male character written by a woman. In spite of Jacob's frustrating helplessness at times, I loved how realistic, how passionate and how intense he was about the animals, friends and love he cares for. I appreciated Jacob's passion and intensity minus the inane, repetitious introspection so common to the romance genre. No, guys don't think and muse about things for endless pages, and Gruen thankfully discarded that element of the romance. Things are happening anyway, so Gruen need not fill the pages with cheap introspection.The story actually begins with the ending. It was actually deftly done, and Gruen fills in the details when we encounter the prologue at the very end of the book again. Ironically, this added a measure of suspense to the novel.  As I mentioned before, I thought the book limped to its conclusion. I would have appreciated another chapter in the flashback depicting our protagonists in a new act with another circus.Still, I found the reading experience a captivating novelty to say the least.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"A joy to read\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1195430400, \"reviewTime\": \"11 19, 2007\"}\n",

A friend sent this to me and I finally found the time to read it (plus it was also a group read). The book definitely does live up to its reputation, and I will most likely list it as one of my favorite reads in 2008.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of a man, who now in his golden years, is reminiscing about his past and his days with a traveling circus. The book goes back and forth between the two time periods, the present and the past (Depression era), and I think it was done quite nicely. Jacob Jankowski is the narrator and old man that is looking back on the eccentric life he had with the circus, about the people he met and knew, and the woman that changed his life. While Jacob sits in the old folks home, his mind wanders back to those days, often confusing the present with the past.His past takes us to his story of how he ended up with the circus, just a few college exams short of a degree. His future was to be that of a veterinarian, but that dream was cut short when his parents die suddenly, and he doesn't have the focus to continue. He loses the family home, loses his bright future, and has nowhere to go. Luck brings him to the train that carries the circus from one town to another. He hitches a ride, and thus begins the adventure of a lifetime.The reader will discover that this book is not really about the circus. Yes, most of the story line does take place behind the scenes of a circus, but what WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is really all about is loyalty, friendship and love, and the relationships that Jacob develops during these years with the circus. Comparing Jacob's current life in the seniors' home to what he had in the circus is almost akin to that of a caged animal being locked up. Jacob's time in this seniors' home is stagnating him, and he continues to look back at his younger years with longing. He remembers all that had transpired, his relationships with his fellow circus entertainers and workers, the circus ringmaster, a cruel and dangerous man who had his gentle side, and the ringmaster's wife, Marlena, who is in a way imprisoned in a marriage that she can't get out of.  In the middle of it all is a gentle elephant named Rosie, who becomes an integral part of the circus and an animal that Jacob takes under his wing. It is Rosie's relationship with several of the main characters that helps tell the story of these people, leading back toJacob's present state and where his last remaining days on earth will take him.I highly recommend WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. It's an insightful story about people, in an unusual setting.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Wonderful story!\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1210809600, \"reviewTime\": \"05 15, 2008\"}\n",

The book is told both in the present and in 1931 by Jacob Jankowski. We start with him in an old folk's home, where he tells us he's either 90 or 93. He's past caring at this point about pretty much anything. Then one day he sees a bunch of the other patients gathered at one of the windows. He goes over to see what they are all looking at and finds that the circus is in town, and within throwing distance of his geriatric home.The appearance of the circus brings back memories of his first experience with the circus, which began just as he was finishing his veterinarian degree at Cornell University. He goes through a tragic time and leaves in the middle of his final exams, walking until his legs get tired. Where his legs led him was to the town's railroad tracks. He jumps on the next passing train, although it's late at night and he's not sure what type of train he's just hitched. In the morning he finds that it's a circus train and he's taken on as the circus veterinarian.The book then goes through his time on the circus, his interactions with the beautiful Marlena and her abusive husband, August. Not only does August treat Marlena badly, but he abuses the animals, especially Rosie, the Polish-speaking elephant taken on by Uncle Al, the circus ringleader.I know not all people are huge fans of circuses, but if you can stomach it I highly suggest you read this book. It's obvious from her writing that Gruen has a soft spot for the circus and this time period. She wrote about it in a lovely way, without being too easy on the circus operators. She showed the dark side of the circus (beating animals, low pay, difference between working men and performers, etc.) without overdoing it. I never felt like she was trying to harp on about animal abuse or any of the other terrible things that used to happen in circuses.

A book will become popular and into a popular movie before I read the book. But when I do, I typically enjoy it. Well, I was late with Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.This is a story, if you didn't already know that, about an old man reminiscing about his life with the circus. Jacob is about to become an official vet during the age of Prohibition. Just as he is about ready to sit down and take his final exams, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident and everything had been mortgaged too much. He now is without a family and a home. Instead of taking his exams, he runs off and finds himself on a circus train.Jacob finds himself falling in love with one of the performers who is also the wife of his boss. It all gets ugly as his boss reveals physiological problems resulting in death at times. Jacob develops friends in the most unlikely places including that of a large elephant.Ms. Gruen does an excellent job going back and forth in time as Jacob is an old man dealing with growing old and as a young man not sure who he is or where his future lies. The loneliness of the assisted living is shown with deep emotion, and the dirty side of the glamorous circus is laid out before the reader.This is one of those books that you'll either love or hate. It is not action packed. Most of the action does not occur till very late in the book. The majority of the story is slow as it goes through many of the mental thoughts of Jacob and the detailed life of a circus performer and worker. I found it easy to put down and resume reading at a later time. But I am very glad I read it. It is a good read, but a read that only those that prefer slower, deep readings can enjoy.There is graphic language and scenes that might be offensive to some though they are not many. It is not a pretty story as the life of the circus was hard and dirty.

It turned out to be a very well written and beautiful story about love, hardships, and a circus. It's the great depression 1932, prohibition is in full swing, and like so many others a young man has had his entire life torn into pieces and ends up wandering straight into the adventure of a lifetime.  Jake Jankowski, the main character in our epic story, is distraught when he is informed that both his parents have died in an automobile accident. After, what we can only assume is a nervous breakdown while taking his final exams for veterinary school; he walks out and continues until he cannot bear to go any further.  While resting near a train track as a train rumbles up, and he decides to try to \\\"hitch\\\" a ride to the next town not realizing he has jumped aboard a circus train.  From there he meets many characters who will forever change his life.I found myself falling in love right along with him, hating the villain with a fiery passion, and cheering for a quirky elephant named Rosie whom Sara Gruen describes so vividly that you can't help but smile.  Sara Gruen manages to create a scene so well you can imagine yourself there, but she never loses you with too many details.  Personally, I am torn whether or not I love this story.  In the first half of the book when she is setting a scene she would add some explicit details that weren't necessary. Since she had already masterfully created her setting and by adding those I can only assume she was after shock value.  I did enjoy the story, but I have a hard time swallowing adultery, I guess I have just been married too long.  I can understand why the characters were drawn to each other and why she would cheat on her husband, but I don't personally enjoy it.  In my opinion she could have used something else for her characters to over-come.  It's not like they didn't have three or four other obstacles to surmount.

I must admit that I appreciated the old man's story in the nursing home more than the kid on the train, but that's just me.  The one thing I noticed right off the bat is that this writer took very seriously - \\\"don't tell, show\\\" and show she does in sometimes tedious plodding, even disgusting detail.This can actually become tiresome.I was surprised because my favorite author is a \\\"show-er\\\", and I love to read her work, but maybe it's the fact that she has never written something as long as this.In anycase, I have not gone through the thousands of reviews there are, but there are over 1500 5 star reviews, and I can't help but wonder - if the protagonist was a woman, and what happened to Jacob that night he drank entriely too much had happened to her - would it not be considered a rape or sexual assault of some kind?  Has the definition changed since I was younger?  I just have a big feeling that if it was a woman who was drunk out of her mind and two overly friendly men thought they would *welcome* her to the circus at that very time in her state of no mind - it would be all hell and high water in here - not 1500 five star reviews.

Who will care?You know what else gets me?  When you take away the wordiness of this book, the premise, plot and story of young Jacob is so painfully simple it's not even funny, there is NO development of the relationship between he and Marlena.  *Spoiler Alert*  It all boils down to boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl gets beat up by her abusive husband, boy hates husband, husband gets miraculously killed - boy runs away with girl they have tons of kids and live happily ever after.

Still, I found myself thinking about it often when I wasn't reading.  Even though the plot is romantic at the bare-bones level, I never really felt like I was reading a romance.  Gruen does a wonderful job descibing the details of the circus, and I was more interested in the day-to-day details of train circuses than the romance.  I thought the interaction between characters and the historical element complimented each other well.If you read this book, be sure to read the interview with the author (at the end of the paperback edition).  Interestingly, Gruen admits that she had never been to a circus (never been to a circus???) before writing this book.  I see that as a testimony to the quality of her research and her writing.  I also love the way she integrates real stories that she has heard from circus folks with her fictional tale (all explained in the interview).Honestly, I thought the \\\"prologue\\\" was kind of a sell out.

Now of course, this type of circus is almost extinct due to the cruel treatment of both animals and those that they marketed as \\\"freaks\\\", but there's no doubt that almost as much action and adventure happened outside of the ring as inside. The \\\"Greatest show on earth\\\" was just as good a description of life on these itinerant circuses as it was to the events shown to they paying public. In the US, these great circus extravaganzas travelled by rail, and the collection of desperate workers, preening performers and animals ensured an interesting mix.Sara Gruen's tale begins with a wonderfully touching portrait of a 90-ish old man, Jacob, now left to live out his days in a nursing home. But in his youth, he was employed as a circus vet (although unqualified) and what a tale he recalls. Incidentally, the name Jacob is clearly intentional as there are a number of references on the life of the biblical Jacob from Genesis - although they are subtle and only add, rather than distract from the story.Gruen has clearly researched her subject in great depth (the addition of vintage photos from the era before each chapter that is devoted to the past is a nice touch) and there's a suggestion that at least some of the stories included either did happen or are rumoured to have happened. Just occasionally her explanations are a little clumsy, but they are needed to explain some of the terminology. But most importantly, she manages to get a sense of the faded grandeur and charged atmosphere of these great circus trains.At heart, this is a love story with a list of characters that include a grumpy dwarf, a drink-sodden old timer, a beautiful performer, a naiive vet, a mad director of animals, a toothless lion and a charismatic elephant. What's not to love?A movie is due out shortly, but although not having seen it of course, it's a fair bet there will be some Hollywood style sugar coating of this tale. The book includes both some steamy scenes as well as some gritty and potentially disturbing descriptions of animal conditions - and it's all the better for that dark side - so read the book at least before seeing the movie.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Roll up, roll up\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1294876800, \"reviewTime\": \"01 13, 2011\"}\n",

But that's not going to stop me from trying, because I have confidence and determination and I often find myself in lineups where I'm the one who appears out of line. And when weirdness and eccentricities are encouraged, it tends to work better than Miracle-Gro and direct sunlight and watering.Jacob Jankowski proves more than a little odd beneath his shirt collar. He has flashbacks to his circus days where he spent all of his time shoveling excrement and smashing watermelons and filing toenails (Rosie's) and hopping on trains and off trains and carrying knives between his teeth and chasing after married women and chasing after elephants and shoving his hand in a tiger's cage and waiting for the flag to drop and speaking Polish (most of which I didn't understand) and training elephants and speaking more Polish. But I could relate rather easily because I spend much of my time staring at white space and filling it with Times New Roman font and pretending that people actually think I'm witty and charming and wonderful when my reviews and novels are placed in avid reader's hands. Because if Jacob hadn't skipped out on one life to chase after another and I couldn't pretend I was someone else for hours at a time, the real world might close in faster than a mushroom cooked in a skillet.But I wasn't blissfully ignorant after this tale, though. Finding out many of the antidotes contained in this story were at least partially, or in some cases whole-heartedly, based on actual events with the names changed to protect the guilty proved a rather outstanding addition. Since, on occasion, I do like the prospect of getting smarter, especially when I can have fun while doing it. And this was a rather enjoyable tale with Uncle Al and Rosie and August and Marlena and Kinko and plenty of other secondary characters with full-fledged personalities who proved to be more than just a series of caricatures thrown in for good measure to make the main character look pretty and exciting and interesting.Set during a rather depressing time in our nation's history, this story wasn't the least bit depressing, although men were tossed from the train faster than shot glasses tossed back at a bar by some guy with antelopes for arms. While that might turn folks off, I was rather pleased with the thought of bubble gum and candy corn and candied apples. If I want to feel dejected and disheartened, I can find plenty of reasons to sit in a corner with my head pushing against my ankles, thank you very much. I don't need it from a vessel that I like to use as an escape hatch from the real world where fairies and wands and cooch tents and sexy sheer night gowns and six-dollar smiles and two-dollar whores can be had whenever the mood strikes.If I didn't end with more than a few words on Barbara, though, my world wouldn't be complete. She commanded center stage at the cooch tent with her foot long breasts and feminine wiles and brown nipples the size of paper plates and painted expressions, as she danced and swung her hips like a supermodel down a runway. Her happy sacks increased in width at the end and her smudged lipstick and smokin' tobacco and sexy sheer nightgown where I could literally see and hear her bare breasts slapping together. All of which resulted in a totally titillating experience from which I shall never be the same.As for this novel, it proved to be a rather entertaining escape from reality.Robert DownsAuthor of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Escape From The Real World\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1378512000, \"reviewTime\": \"09 7, 2013\"}\n",

Hedges\", \"helpful\": [2, 3], \"reviewText\": \"I almost exclusively read nonfiction, with perhaps one or two novels a year thrown in for a diversion. This book was given to me and came with highest recommendations, so I started reading it on a plane trip. I am normally not especially captivated by fiction, but suffice it to say that I read the book over the course of one day because I enjoyed the characters so much. The book is told in flashbacks by a 93 year old man, and addresses his years as the vet on a circus train. I found the wraparound scenes of Jacob useful for the introduction and the wonderful conclusion, but if there was one thing I would have changed about the story it was the incessant excursions to the present sprinkled throughout the story which really don't advance the plot other than to explain some issues about senior care in an assisted living community.The book begins with a delightfully deceptive prologue, setting the reader up for a surprise at the climax. I must admit that I had my suspicions about the murder in question, but found the execution to be more skillful than I had imagined. The victim, August, is a megalomaniac with a temper and forms one point in a love triangle with the protagonists, Jacob and Marlena. The circus, run by slimy vermin \\\"Uncle Al\\\" is well fleshed out with interesting characters and terminology that Gruen incorporates flawlessly into the book. I found the character of Walter (Kinko the Clown) to be the perfect complement to play off of Jacob and their relationship was one of the most interesting parts of the novel for me.Gruen handles difficult situations well, even delving into dreams vividly, as when she relates Jacob's nightmare of struggling to get back on the train while pursued by malevolent animals (\\\"Behind us, a wall of badgers. In front of us, a dozen alligators.\\\") Her turn of phrase and tendency to sly understatement is notable throughout, and adds to the story as much by omission as by overt statements. The pivotal murder is one of the most brilliant ever concocted, and the subtlety of its telling, particularly in contrast to the version in the prologue is exquisite: the wording was changed very slightly to enlighten the reader to a plot twist that may or may not have been expected, but nonetheless was wonderfully executed. The ending of the book was likewise unexpected inasmuch as the reader is so focused on the story of Jacob in the circus, they aren't giving as much consideration to the 93 year old who is actually narrating the book.As I mentioned before, there is more narration here than is absolutely necessary (but then again I normally read technical nonfiction), and as an animal lover the cruelty to animals is appalling (even if it's fiction, and despite it being historically based) although admittedly necessary to develop the plot. I mention this as the book may not be suitable for some younger readers for this reason. I found Gruen's choice of the name Jacob, and the obvious Biblical references to Jacob found in Genesis compelling and one of the things that separates this book from most contemporary fiction.Although light reading on one level, this book also deals skillfully with difficult issues, has excellent character development, and a couple of great plot twists. Also included are interviews with the author and a set of book group discussion questions, which were not written by Gruen, and which I found contrived and dull.\\\"Water For Elephants\\\" did what a good novel is supposed to do: it captivated my interest from start to finish, and I couldn't put it down.

He is cowered by Marlena's husband all the time. He is unadventurous when it comes to sexual escapades; he is just too shy, too immature to appeal to me. Also, the love story was not developed well at all. There is no palpable attraction. Marlena is created into the damsel in distress, stuck with an abusive husband, and Jacob is thrown in to rescue her. I think this damsel in distress aspect has been over done.

It is by turns heartwarming, heartbreaking, exciting, and horrifying--with an ending that took me by surprise. I enjoy circus stories and have read several, none as good as this one (with the exception of Gus the Great). If you're old enough to remember the film The Greatest Show on Earth, this is it but without the slick DeMille romanticism. Water for Elephants is raw and realistic, one man's life in a circus and in a nursing home. There are other reviews here that give details of the plot so I won't repeat what they've said.There is a lot I loved about this book--the character of Jacob, the circus atmosphere,the story itself. It has many remarkable elements.One of the most remarkable is the nursing home part of the story. The author appears to be fairly young, several decades too young to know what it feels like to be elderly, to know you are failing physically, to be afraid you're failing mentally, to remember vividly when you were young and know you will never be young again. Yet she very convincingly shows you the heart and mind of a feisty old man. All in all, it's one of the best historical novels I have ever read. I wish I had written it.The above was the text of my original review and I stand by it. However, something vauguely bothered me about the book. Then, following a discussion I reread it and did a little research of my own. Now I know what it was. She is several years too early in her use of \\\"paranoid schizophrenia\\\". By the time the old man is TELLING the story it would be in use, but certainly was not in use at the time she has a character using the term, and this seems like insufficient, possibly sloppy research. The other thing was the slaughter of several horses by cutting their throats. Horse people I know questioned it. A horse is big and powerful and would be frightened, not likely to let it happen unless he was heavily medicated. It seems done only for the effect of the gore. A properly placed gunshot would serve and be more merciful, more logical.However, I still think it's an outstanding book, even with the flaws, and I still wish I'd written it.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Brilliant but flawed\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1211500800, \"reviewTime\": \"05 23, 2008\"}\n",

The answer, of course, is experience, the real question being how one describes that crucial intangible.  Water for Elephants is the story of a man's youth, the experience he gains in a short period of time.  Essentially, it begins with him walking out on his final college exams and jumping a circus train almost accidentally.  This book is actually structured as a series of flashbacks, with the main character in roughly the present day, bracketing each chapter with comments about his current situation in a nursing home as contrast to his past adventures.  The main action takes place during the Great Depression, making for a fairly historical novel.Water for Elephants may feature a fairly original character with some serious common sense deficiencies, but Sara Gruen clearly did her research in terms of depictions of the period, inclusion of trade lingo, and depictions of animal behavior.  The adultery will probably keep it off high school reading lists, but I found it a pretty good window on what it depicted of the world outside of the circus.  This particular copy of the book also includes some commentary at the end regarding real circus history and anecdotes that were included in with the fiction.  Other than that, I know too little about life under the big top to comment on the depiction of events, other than to say that trains often did go slow enough to jump back then, even in the countryside, unlike now.I read this novel in less than a day, finding it to be a very compelling read, with a plot full of twists, even though the most climactic scene is also presented as the hook in the beginning preface chapter.  I would generally recommend it to everyone, even if you think you would have a problem with some aspects of it.  Try to give it a chance.

Jacob soon becomes the vet for the animals, but it's his interactions with August, Uncle Al, and Marlena that challenge his convictions.

She's done her research and it shows. I especially liked how she used pictures to frame each chapter. The storyline is interesting. Jacob is coming-of-age and has to make decisions that aren't easy. The story alternates between old Jacob and young Jacob, and while not linear, Gruen pulls on the reader's heartstrings with the challenges old Jacob faces.

But I'm here to tell you that, in the case of Water for Elephants, it is definitely better late than never.Even in Depression-era America, Jacob Jankowski is doing pretty well for himself. He is a Cornell-trained veterinarian who only needs to sit for his final exams to make it official. He thinks he is in love but his lack of experience with the ladies means that he is more likely to be in lust than in love. For him, life is still pretty good.But things change sometimes when one least expects it, and for Jacob change comes in the form of a tragic traffic accident that claims the lives of both his parents. As bad as that is, it gets even worse when he learns that he has also been left destitute because his parents mortgaged everything to pay his Cornell tuition, and Jacob finds that he cannot sit still even long enough to finish his exams. Wanting to get away from it all, he hops the first freight train that comes along, avoids getting thrown back onto the tracks, and soon enough finds himself a member of Benzini Brothers traveling circus.Sara Gruen lets Jacob tell his own story by alternating the first person narrative of ninety-something-year-old Jacob, now living in a nursing home, with the voice of twenty-three-year-old Jacob as he experiences his summer with the Benzini Brothers. And what a story it is because the Benzini Brothers circus is not exactly The Ringling Brothers show and only circus owner, Uncle Al, tries to pretend that it is. Everything about the Benzini Brothers is second rate: the ragged animals in the zoo's menagerie are badly treated and lucky to eat once a day, the roustabouts and other workers are not paid consistently, the freaks are usually fakes or not all that freakish in the first place, and the girly show performer has been known to take paying customers after show hours.Jacob manages to catch on permanently with the show even with his incomplete veterinarian credentials and all goes relatively well until he falls in love with two ladies: Rosie, the elephant who joins the circus after he does, and Marlena, the beautiful young equestrian performer unfortunately married to the sadistic August, a man who beats both Marlena and Rosie.Gruen paints an unforgettable picture of life in a small-time Depression-era circus, an environment filled with filth, underfed animals and humans, cruelty, alcohol abuse, varying degrees of crime, lust, and callousness. Jacob, appalled at what he sees and what he learns about August, Marlena and Uncle Al, fights to maintain his sense of decency in a world he never knew existed, but his love for a married woman and his guilt at not doing more to defend Rosie from the beatings she suffers at the hands of August has him doubting himself.Surprisingly, as intriguing as the young Jacob's story is, the nursing home predicament that the older Jacob finds himself in is an equally touching one. The audio version of \\\"Water for Elephants\\\" (10 CDs and 11  hours long) is read by David LeDoux, as the young Jacob Jankowski and John Randolph Jones, who turns in an absolutely brilliant performance as Jacob, the old man. Frankly, both of the worlds created by Gruen are somewhat horrifying and both will linger in my memory for a long time.\\\"Water for Elephants\\\" is, however, a tiny bit blemished by its unlikely ending even though it is the kind of fairy tale ending that I personally would have wished for Mr. Jankowski. Some things, though, are just too good to be true - or to ring true in a novel even as good as this one.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"A Love Affair: Rosie, Marlena and Jacob\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1229299200, \"reviewTime\": \"12 15, 2008\"}\n",

I am glad I did with this one because it had me asking the same questions The Hunger Games had me asking. (Maybe I'm destined to read books witht his theme until I figure out an answer or something like an answer from these texts.)The questions:  Why are people cruel? and Why do people put up with cruel people shaping their lives by maiming their lives?  In other words, why don't we naturally insist on freedom and peace?Water for Elephants author Sara Gruen has main character Jacob Jankowski, a Cornell-educated veterinarian who has not yet sat his exams because his parents died in a car crash shortly before he was scheduled to take them, working with a carnival during the Depression.  His cross-country train journey with the carnival takes him deep into the world of self-loathing, disappointment, betrayal, convenient friendship, and back-stabbing like there's no tomorrow.  At the center of that world is the woman named Marlena who becomes the love of his life and an elephant named Rosie who understands Polish. Both these ladies suffer beyond belief at the hands of August, Marlena's husband, the equestrian manager of the circus, and a paranoid schizophrenic whose physical and emotional abuse of anyone and everyone is terrifying.Only reluctantly did I put the book down whenever Rosie or Marlena became August's whipping posts. I wondered when Jacob would protect his women.  It wasn't enough he felt bad later for not standing up for Marlena or Rosie.  When would Jacob live up to his potential and do right?Which situation led me to wonder why some people are cruel and why so many others put up with them.  No answers yet. I'll keep reading.Gruen paints a world within a world when she draws the Depression-era carnival with her words. Its a tough place with a strict social order and very little hope for more or better. People are not diminished for holding onto what they have but for holding on at all costs. Time and time again, this novel shows that this kind of holding on is not worth it. Nevertheless, the hopelessness spawned by the Depression make moral compromises seem reasonable, logical.Water for Elephants is Jacob's memoir of his circus days. A nursing home inmate whose spirit refuses to be shackled to the home's waiting for death raison d'etre, he recounts his story 70 years or more after the fact, beginning with his nursing home experiences to a very sympathetic audience.  Life is not over for Jacob.This is a story of personal freedom that asks what price a person is willing to pay for it.

All of the ills of the times are reflected in the microcosm of Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth: the lack of jobs, companies that don't pay their workers, the terror of the weak, the hand-to-mouth existence that goes on day after day. The circus, which is the escapism dream of many people, is, in reality, a harsher existence than the world outside.

She never truly seemed to grasp the extent of Uncle Al's and August's cruelty.

I too own horses, been around them and vets for nearly 5 decades. What little circus animal veterinary work Ms. Gruen describes in the book she probably got watching a cable TV station animal special.I also concur with the veterinarian reviewer on the slaughter of the horses. If a horse is forced to watch the other beside it die violently, most likely when it smells all that blood, you can bet the ranch it would break its' halter or rope and be nine miles gone.I also found it very distracting the numerous referrals to minute body languages while the characters talked. Also, even though the story started pretty promising, once Jacob got established as an employee in the circus, it bottomed out into nothing but petty bickerings and jealousies among all the circus employees. Yawn....It was fast reading, but I started hoping the thing would end soon. And, yeah, the animal stampede at the end I wasn't buying. I think Ms. Gruen could have just watched Nat.

The frustration with this battle between body and mind is poignantly revealed as we watch him testing the limits of his mobility and self-perseverance. Most of the time his `cantankerous' behavior is met with unsympathetic results.It's easy to understand how eating a steady diet of tediously bland and mushy foods when one has the teeth to chew on a cob of corn or a piece of meat could make one somewhat cranky!Had he been in his own home or cared for by relatives, the result probably would have been different....he'd have gotten a `real' dinner instead of visit by the Home's Psychiatrist with a diagnosis of geriatric depression followed by an unwanted dosing of Elavil.By alternating back in forth in time, I was able to be more empathetic with the 90 (or 93) year old Jacob. Seeing his youthful tragedies and how this angst over the sudden loss of his parents forces his life in a totally new and unexpected course is pivotal.He flees to survive.... and survive he does.... in a very gritty and cut-throat environment.There is no \\\"safety net\\\" under this circus act and it's every man for himself. Given the time (depression-era) and situation, the harshness of this existence becomes quite credible.I think that this tough past, in part, helps the reader to understand why he's not very comfortable being coddled and restricted within the sanitary and ordered life of the Nursing Facility.He is left unchallenged and bored without much support from his dutiful, albeit rather distant children and grandchildren. He misses the unpredictability and excitement of his former Circus Life and of course the love of his life, Marlena.The different voices helped to move the story along and not keep the reader too long in any one place, while allowing the story to unfold with some genuine surprises.Highly recommended!\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"A Circus that you'll not soon forget!\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1191283200, \"reviewTime\": \"10 2, 2007\"}\n",

Jacob Jankowski is now ninety three years old and in an \\\"assisted living\\\" facility, when the circus comes to town.  This brings back startling memories of his early life, when his world fell apart and he found himself on a circus train heading into his future.On the brink of passing his final exams for veterinary school, Jacob is informed that his parents have just died in an automobile accident.  Adding insult to injury, their house and practice were mortgaged to pay for his school and there's nothing left for Jacob.  He walks out of his final exam and keeps walking, until finding himself beside a railroad track.  Jumping the next train, he later realizes it's a circus train.  An old man named Camel helps him out, and gets him hired on with the show as the veterinarian.Jacob winds out bunking with a recalcitrant dwarf named Kinko and working for a man named August who's married to Marlena, a horse performer and a beautiful woman.  Marlena is off-limits, but Jacob can't help but admire her from afar.A twist of fate bring Rosie to the scene, an elephant abandoned by another defunct circus.  It seems Rosie is useless as a performer, and left under August's brutal treatments, until Jacob discovers that Rosie responds to the Polish language rather than English.  Once the language barrier is broken, Rosie becomes a star.  I could keep prattling on but I don't want to ruin the book.'Water For Elephants' is a beautifully written tale.  Switching back and forth between Jacob's current situation in his nursing home and his memories of the past, there's never a slow moment in Gruen's perfect prose.  The story is rich and well researched, the characters practically sparkle with life, and I could smell the animals and feel the train lurching beneath my feet.This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I suppose it helps that I love circus books and freak show books, but 'Water For Elephants' is more a book on humanity, and what sometimes lurks beneath the smiles and happy faces of troubled minds.  It's about greed and cliques, its about the depression era job desperation, its about abuse, and most of all its about the human heart.  Don't miss out on this 10 star tale.

The story revolves around Jacob, a Cornell trained veterinary student who drops out suddenly before his final exams after the loss of his parents and joins a circus traveling by train across the country. The story is split into two perspectives: the story of 90 something year Jacob, now suffering from dementia (and struggling with the loss of his dignity) in an assisted living facility, recounting his youth as the circus veterinarian in flashbacks. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It is obvious that Sara Gruen put a great deal of research into circus life, which I found fascinating. I had an extremely difficult time reading about the animal abuse, although perhaps this was necessary within the plot to enhance the reader's hatred for August and Uncle Al (as if the redlighting was not enough!).

As Jacob tells the story of his early 20s: the untimely death of his parents, his ivy league veterinary education put on hold, a random desparate act of hopping a circus train, coming to terms with his own self & sexuality, learning to fight for what is right; all during the height of the depression and prohibition, you become enthralled. I loved the characters he encountered, the awkwardness of his younger self as he figured out life, love, and passion, and of course the animals he cared for.  Rosie, the intelligent, beautiful elephant ... well,  you fall in love with her right along with Jacob. This was one of those occasions where you love the book so much as you're reading, that the closer you get to the conclusion, you get really scared that the author is going to drop the ball. Even though I experienced that fright, the ending Gruen gave for Jacob and co was absolutely perfect. *hugs*Complaints? I think the character of Marlena could've been developed a bit more. You cared about her, but only through the glimpses Jacob gave of her. Other than that, I don't really have much to complain about. Yes, I'm reaching...Water For Elephants is just one of those rare books you want to snuggle with and talk sweet nothings to; you want to beg it to come back and stay, stay forever!  Sara Gruen brought to life an amazing world; it seems rare to love a book this much these days, but she made me a believer, and she's got a new fan for life.Now let's just hope the movie version comes anywhere close to how great the book is!\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Amazing adventure that I want to snuggle with!\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1296518400, \"reviewTime\": \"02 1, 2011\"}\n",

One is the present day, real-life existance of elderly residents in an assisted living facility. Their story is told through the eyes of a \\\"90-something\\\" year old man recuperating from a broken hip. At the same time, this character, Jacob we learn is his name, regales us with  life as a member of a circus from the past. Both stories are filled with such strong detail that we as the reader, are drawn back and forth from the past to the present in gentle surprise. We are introduced to the emotional roller-coaster details of a young man's life, many of which he is not a willing participant. However, we learn that he has a depth of character and courage that carries him through life's troubles when many of us today would want to give up. We find him using those same character traits to overcome some \\\"curve-ball throws\\\" that at \\\"93\\\", life is still pitching his way. Ms. Gruen has done a superb job of blending the past and present, and even gives us a hint of the future of this gallant man's life. Her book is so well researched that the reader might begin to feel it is a biography rather than fiction. This book will hold your interest throughout, especially the tales of the circus from a by-gone era and even the unfortunate activities of life in elder-care facilities that haunt us today. However, she does not leave us feeling sad and remiss about a touchy subject, but instead gives us a surprise ending that is upbeat and hopeful.By: Sherry M.

The most moving, authentic passages were delivered by 93-year-old Jacob Jankowski. You just gotta love this elderly gent. The chapters in his voice gave me a new understanding of what it means to be old and alone; the fact that Gruen could craft such a believable male character, to my way of thinking anyhow, redeems many of this book's other flaws.I read numerous positive and negative reviews on amazon, and I agree with several other reviewers that Jacob can sometimes be a bit frustrating, in that he fails to take appropriate action when it seems most called for, and at other times gets all up-in-arms and confrontational over far lesser infractions. But to me, this makes him a human and believable character. Haven't we all \\\"lamed out\\\" when we should have taken action, or overreacted when we shouldn't have? What I hate even more is when a character is always ready, willing and able to jump through impossible hoops to save the day. If I only wanted that in my literary characters, I'd stick to James Bond novels. I do, however, agree with many other reviewers who pointed out that some dialogue is a bit too pat and unbelievable for both the era and the circumstances in which this story is supposed to have taken place.But what I simply do not get is why so many readers are up in arms about the so-called graphic sex scenes. They were neither numerous nor particularly offensive, but I guess sensibilities are wide-ranging where sex is concerned. I suppose the sideshow scene with Barbara and her magnificent boobs could be characterized as somewhat sexist, but so what? It was provocative and engaging. And while that scene and Jacob's \\\"initiation\\\" could be labeled both gratuitous and graphic,  I would argue that any graphic sex scene is gratuitous. Writers always have the option of \\\"panning to the flickering candle\\\" rather than telling us what the heck is happening. I give an author points for taking the risk of telling me. Besides which, I'd consider the absence of raunchy performances and sexual hanky-panky in a book about a traveling circus to be an inauthentic, gaping omission. So while I could have taken or left these two particular scenes, I believe they were well written and have their place in this story.All of that said, my biggest complaints about this book are Marlena's shallowness, and the mounting melodrama as the story nears its (preposterous) ending. Though Marlena is perhaps the second most important character in this novel, I found her to be vapid, insipid and uninspiring. I thought Rosemary (the assisted-living home nurse) was far more endearing and believable, for as minor a character as she was. True, the villains (Uncle Al, August) were likewise a bit \\\"canned,\\\" but I can forgive a lack of character development for certain secondary characters because, after all, an author has but so many pages in which to tell her story. But Marlena, as the circus's star performer and Jacob's love interest, should have been better developed.  And I suppose I simply must accept the ending for what it is--something of an outrageous letdown.Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed Water for Elephants. It drew me in enough to hold my interest, and it certainly has its strong points. For example, I thought the author did a fabulous job bringing the animal characters to life as sentient, unique beings. I loved the aged Jacob, and liked his young counterpart only slightly less. I will admit, I expect more from (and am therefore harder on) traditionally-published books than self-published ones so I gave Water for Elephants three stars rather than four. If a writer is lucky enough to get published, then I hold him or her to a higher standard than schlubs like myself who try to put a good, thought-provoking product before the public without the benefit of editors, professional cover designers or national distribution networks. More power to Sara Gruen for being among the fortunate few to land a publishing deal.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Enjoyable, But Not a Home Run\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1344902400, \"reviewTime\": \"08 14, 2012\"}\n",

It captures a time and environment that stirs the curiosity of young and old.  Who wouldn't be interested in exploring the dysfunctional dynamics of the circus family, during the perilous era of the early 30's. It allows you to finally be able to, run away to the circus, in the comfort and safety of your easy chair.  And, as intriguing as some scenes might be, it makes you just as glad you never did.While written simplistically, the messages run deep.  The cruelty that existed during those hard times and the effect on man and beast, were heartbreaking.  It was particularly difficult to envision the animal abuse and neglect, but it was so integral to the story that you had no choice.  It was a reminder, that left unchecked and unsupervised, that the weakest amongst us will frequently be delegated the scapegoats.  It was also a reminder of the evil that can be unleashed by man when faced with desperate times.Visiting the Senior Jankowski was particularly delightful.  A mere \\\"90, or maybe 93,\\\" as he frequently chimed, his struggle to retain dignity and independence was inspirational and beautifully drawn out.  Gruen also did a great job moving seamlessly between the Senior Jankowski and his youthful, 23 year old counterpart. Sometimes I wouldn't even notice, even though decades separated the characters, when we'd moved from one to the other, which is not easily accomplished.  They were both struggling with the angst of the past, the ugliness of the moment and the uncertainty of moving forward.I've read reviews where some took exception to using Schizophrenia as an excuse for one of the characters cruelty and explosive episodes, as his behaviors were not typical for Schizophrenia.  And, they definitely weren't!  However, in the 30's Schizophrenia was not well understood and likely frequently misdiagnosed, becoming a catch-all for describing many signs of mental illness. I don't believe this should detract from the story.My grievances are few, but I did have some issues with the ending, which I found unrealistic, although I'm not sure we were intended to interpret the ending so concretely.  If you take it beyond face value, the ending can have some very deep meaning.  I think it depends entirely on the reader to decide for themselves.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Water for the spirit...\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1212796800, \"reviewTime\": \"06 7, 2008\"}\n",

That is, to get so involved in the storyline, I forget about my immediate environment.  Authors can achieve this goal by producing actions that borderlines the plausible.  When actions are too plausible, the novel becomes trite.  As a consequence, a reader will lose interest.  When the actions totally lack plausibility the reader becomes aware of one's immediate environment.  Within this scenario, the author forces the reader to assess the logic of the actions and the flow of the storyline is disrupted.  Somewhere between plausible and implausible is best for a storyline.Although Gruen is a talented writer with a rare command of the written word, her description of flunking out of Veterinarian school was too implausible.  EVEN Cornell professors would give a second chance if a student's parents died prior to comprehensive exams!  The implausible wrinkle forced me into reality throughout my reading experience.  It wasn't until the chapter 23 (page 314) when I realized that Gruen skillfully left out some critical information.  Thus, what seemed too implausible at the beginning became reasonable at the end.  We reach borderline plausibility.Yet, the novel doesn't end there.  A second storyline that Gruen skillfully weaves throughout the novel emerges into a second borderline plausible event.

Schell\", \"helpful\": [1, 1], \"reviewText\": \"In a long list of critical praise on the first four pages of the paperback edition for Water For Elephants, The Chicago Tribune is quoted as saying the novel is \\\"so compelling, so detailed and vivid, that I couldn't bear to be torn away from it for a single minute\\\".My sentiments exactly.Water For Elephants is one of the most engrossing novels I've read so far this year (another is Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns) and now that I have finished it in what seemed a whirlwind of time (I stay at home with two small children and I still read it in three days!), Sara Gruen is among my list of favorite authors.  I look forward to the debut of her fourth novel Ape House scheduled to be released in October of this year.The Canadian-American author doesn't waste any time putting the reader in suspense.  The novel starts off smack dab in the midst of a cacophonous stampede of circus animals (lions and tigers and bears, oh my!) and someone's impending doom.  Want to find out what happened?  Read the book and I'll guarantee you won't stop `til you reach the end.  The engrossing tale is told in flashbacks from the mind of Jacob Jankowski, a man who is encroaching the end of his life at an impressive ninety years of age (\\\"...or ninety-three.  One or the other.\\\").  Jacob resides at an assisted living facility and is the consummate old fart, crotchety and bitter about the black void of his current living.  It isn't until word that the circus is coming to town that something inside of him stirs and memories of his youth from the furthest recesses of his mind float to the murky surface.We are suddenly thrust into the past at the inception of the Great Depression.  Jacob is twenty-three and a student in his final year at Cornell University working towards a degree in veterinary sciences when he is pulled out of class one day in 1931 to earth-shattering news - his parents are dead after a sudden and fatal car accident.  Left with little to fall back on, Jacob takes a short leave and returns to school to finish out the year but his grief over the loss of his mother and father shadows his professional goals and he walks out in the middle of his final test, the integral exam that will earn him his degree.  Having committed career suicide, Jacob goes walking aimlessly for an entire afternoon and inexplicably jumps a passing train in the night.  Little does he know that this one small act has just changed his entire future.After being roughed up by a car full of \\\"working men\\\", Jacob learns that he has just boarded the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth (\\\"You done landed yer ass on a circus, boy\\\"), a big top rivaling the Ringling Brothers and headed by tyrannical ringmaster Alan Bunkel, dubbed \\\"Uncle Al\\\".  It isn't until he lets loose that he's a Cornell-educated vet that he gets placed in the menagerie working with all the animals, in particular a bull elephant named Rosie.  Jacob grows fond of Rosie as well as the other animals but his heart really belongs to a woman named Marlena, a resplendent young performer who is inconveniently married to an emotionally unstable man named August, the equestrian director and superintendent of animals.  As Jacob's love for Marlena grows, so does his hatred of August as he watches him grow ever more suspicious and ever more brutal.  His violent streak spills over onto Rosie, who is rumored to be \\\"dumb as rocks\\\" and disobedient ever since she was acquired and August makes her pay for her insubordination with recurrent vicious floggings.To make matters worse, Uncle Al constantly shafts his workers and performers by docking and/or refraining to pay them for their work and when someone's authority is unduly challenged, people mysteriously disappear in the dead of night.  Jacob's unwavering morals suddenly pit him in a dangerous situation and with a love triangle rapidly brewing and a wild animal reaching its breaking point, the thunder will crack loud and hard before the storm.The book flits back and forth between the past and present and the transition is fluid - there is no confusion between the youthful Jacob and his ninety-year old self.  The descriptions of the circus are vivid, particularly the behavior of the animals within the menagerie.  Being an avid supporter of numerous animal and wildlife charities, this isn't a surprise coming from Gruen and it's some very interesting character development indeed.Her human counterparts in the story don't suffer from this, thankfully.  Jacob is a well-written character, the youthful version brimming with naivete and conviction and the older of course wiser but still resolute as ever.  Gruen shows with Jacob that even after the utmost disastrous of events that time can reign down upon a life, some things about our character ultimately never change.  The unpredictability of August is also queerly fascinating - with expertly written passages of steely smiles, cold gazes and passive-aggressive undertones, the reader will feel just as perplexed and wary of him as Jacob does.Along with extensive research on the subject of circuses during the Depression, Gruen included 17 black-and-white archival photos of circuses throughout the 1930's; the photos are prominently featured at the beginning of about every other chapter and lend the story some great visuals to feed upon.Bottom Line: A superb novel, well worth the time and money to read.  With a movie deal in the works, pick it up now before the film adaptation spoils it in either the best or worst way.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Gruen Is Greatness\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1212105600, \"reviewTime\": \"05 30, 2008\"}\n",

This book is so wonderful, and so very different from anything that I've read, that I still can't believe it.  Sara Gruen has written a book that is so carefully researched and so well-written that it puts the reader right into the story which is Depression-time circus life.  Jacob is a character that is so real, both as he's portrayed at a young age, and as he is portrayed as a 93 year old living with his memories in an old aged home.  The story is poignant and also sad.  It is quite heartbreaking to think of the way the animals lived that travelled with train circuses during this time.  And they had all manner of animals, from elephants to apes to zebras to horses to the big cats like lions and tigers.  They even had polar bears if you can imagine!  This book is dark in its portrayal of circus life circa 1920, but it's also heartwarming in Ms. Gruen's portayal of the many kinds of people that also travelled with these circuses.  These train circuses were an entire community and everyone in them was part of the family, including the animals.  The story is also a love-story that is so beautifully depicted amongst this varied kaleidoscope of characters and the wonderful animals.  And what about amazing Rosie?

Silverman \\\"ReaderGeode\\\"\", \"helpful\": [1, 1], \"reviewText\": \"Change after a life disaster drives this wonderful tale of Jacob and his life for several months thereafter.  Jacob tells the tale himself as a nonagenarian some seven decades after the fact.  His final exams to end his veterinary medicine degree, and his anticipated life following graduation, come to a crashing halt, and leave him wandering aimlessly.  Without considering its consequences, and noticing no details of the train, he stows away on a passing one.  Having hopped a circus train, Jacob initially faces some ugly hardships before his training leads him to his responsibility in the show.  Along the way, Jacob encounters challenges and loyalties, well-meaning others and some with decidedly despicable intentions and/or means.  The characters, the lovely and good-hearted Marlena, who is the star of the show, and her husband August, who is volatile in many unappealing ways, as well as Kinko/Walter, Jacob's initially disgruntled roommate, are reasonably strong secondary characters,  This reader wishes that Marlena had been fleshed out better, but that's a minor complaint.  Jacob is terrific, flawed as Gruen says she wishes of her characters, and a good man placed in difficult circumstances, a circus where the rules don't make much sense, particularly if one holds egalitarian views of one's co-workers.  This reader found the practice of redlighting to be totally repugnant, and frankly a bit upsetting.  Jacob's interaction with the members of the Menagerie, the animals, repeatedly shows his appropriateness for his career.  Several of the animals' personalities stand out.  Jacob in his youth adapts sometimes well and sometimes badly.  Gruen handles Jacob as an old man nicely, making him whole and believable with the challenges of his age, but still generally holding onto his faculties and sense of independence.

The basic string of the plot: a young man, Jacob,  so overcome with grief that he runs away with the circus.  Sounds like a cliche, right? Yet Gruen creates a rich world full of gritty people with lives that figuratively walk a tight rope.  The traveling circus was a roller coaster of success and disappointment - Gruen brings to light the many fascinating facets of this unusual lifestyle.Cliches abound and the plot a little predictable, but it did not distract from the interesting tale.  I would have liked to have seen a little more depth form the main characters. And there were a few unbelievable aspects - leaving an Ivy League education in the final hours, knowing what their family sacrificed to provide it,  just to try and forget their grief?  It would have been very disrespectful and irresponsible to do so.  But, without this selfish act the story would not have moved forward... My favorite aspect was the animals.

What sets Water for Elephants apart is not only the incredible quantity and quality of research that went into it, but the way Gruen employs her pool of researched knowledge to craft her plot, characters and milieu.In lesser hands, a story or book that relies on heavy research can hit the reader over the head with it, to the detriment of concentration and enjoyment. Long explanatory paragraphs; tedious but unnecessary details; the sacrificing of the Big Picture to sideshows--these are sins that are distressingly common in historical novels. It's like the author has taken all this trouble; you've got to see what he dug up, like it or not.In Gruen's case, not one detail is out of place. Not one fact is gratuitous. Everything fits; everything moves the plot along or enhances the characters. The picture develops fully, in living color, without clutter; the settings are so true, you can smell the young hobos and their fire and touch the sweat on the horses. The most unbelievable bit is believable, because you trust Gruen as a storyteller. She is that good a writer.I hate to review a book when so many have, and god knows my opinion won't make a whit's difference in the sales of this book or its success.

If I can get hooked in the first few chapters, well clearly the author deserves the book sale.That is exactly what happened with Water for Elephants.  Almost immediately I was completely drawn into the story.  Ms. Gruen uses an effective framing device for her tale.  Nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski is telling his story in flashbacks from his present in a nursing home.  And it is the story of his first job out of veterinary school.  The year is 1931 and the country is embroiled in the Depression.  Tragedy sends Jacob fleeing his orderly life.  Without trying to, the young man winds up running away to the circus.Water for Elephants is a coming of age novel, a buddy tale, a period drama, and a love story.  It's one of those rare novels that seems to captivate almost all readers.  I came late to it, but I was as entranced as all those who have raved before me.  Gruen's prose is strong, but it's her characters and setting that capture the imagination.  I haven't been to a circus in decades, and have no particular interest in that life.

It turns out to be a circus train.  The story alternates between the few months Jacob spends with the Benzini Bros. circus during the Depression and the current day, in which Jacob is 90+ years old and an unhappy resident of a nursing home.  Although most of the story centers on the circus years, the author does an excellent job of showing the loss of companionship, the loss of independence, and the loss of dignity that accompany old age.  It's these passages that ultimately make this a sad book for me.  No matter how the circus portion of the story turns out, we know how unhappy Jacob is at the tail end of his life.Although Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the unhappily married star of the equestrian act, the love story wasn't the main focus of the story for me.  In fact, that aspect of the story didn't pick up steam until fairly late in the book.  It was more of a coming of age/adventure story.  The author did a wonderful job of researching Depression-era circus life and making the reader a part of it. And what a brutal life it was:  the horrors of poisonous bootleg liquor, prostitution, terrible treatment of both animals and staff members, lack of pay, and &#34;red lighting&#34; - throwing people off the moving train who had fallen out of favor or were simply no longer worth the expense.  If they were lucky, they were thrown off near a town.  If they were unlucky, they were thrown off a trestle.  But it's also a story of survival and caring among both the animals and the people.

Warfield\", \"helpful\": [1, 1], \"reviewText\": \"Author Sara Gruen has given a wonderful, sad, and hopeful picture of circus life and of the life of a young man who joins the circus at twenty-three.  Jacob Jankowski begins the story of his life when he is a very old man living in a nursing home where he is less than happy.  The story goes back to his young life when he is a veterinary student and suddenly loses his parents in an auto crash.  After the funeral, Jacob plans on going back to school and returns, only to be unable to take his exams, writing nothing and walking away from his years of education to join the Benzini Brothers circus. Because of his veterinary knowledge, Jacob is assigned the care of the animals and their problems.August, the animal trainer, is married to Marlena the elephant-rider and beautiful star of the circus.  Jacob's mistake is falling in love with her, because August is a brutal man, both with his animals and with people.  Often an elephant named Rosie gets the brunt of his anger, and so does Marlena, and eventually Jacob.  The rubes suffer under just about everyone in this circus, which has a long way to go to even give Ringling Brothers a thought about it.What I enjoyed most about this book is the very colorful and accurate information that Gruen researched well and delivers about the circus.  The acts in the ring, the different people who make up the circus and the pecking order among them makes for an excellent story.  I found the ending fairly predictable, but I was glad I was right.  Water for Elephants may make you angry, it may make you nostalgic, but it will certainly entertain you and keep you reading until the last page.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"Enjoyment for Humans\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1305849600, \"reviewTime\": \"05 20, 2011\"}\n",

Water for Elephants is a rickety train ride into the dark, seedy, melancholy world of the 1930s circus performer.  But it's a trip worth taking.

In writing about the loss of his parents, he writes how he discovered that his parents mortgaged their home to send him to Ivy league college, probably Cornell University. He drops out and finds himself working at the circus by providing water for elephants. We know he was married for 60 years. The sccene in the lawyer's office discovering his parents' lack of estate was heartbreaking and typical depression era story.

You're going to want to gulp it all down quickly but be advised that you will not have time to savor the rich writing and brilliant characterizations unless you slow down and absorb the tale.Water for Elephants is set in a traveling circus in the early 1930s.  The narrator, Jacob, is set to finish veterinary school and join his father's practice when tragedy strikes, leaving him an orphan and penniless.  Unable to cope with his change in fortune, he wanders off aimlessly and finds himself somehow attached to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, tending to the animals and developing relationships with performers and regular workers alike.  Gruen gives us some of the best characters in this novel:  Marlena, the beautiful horsewoman trapped in a marriage she no longer wants; Walter the dwarf who is forced to share a sleeping berth with Jacob; Camel, the old drunk who meets with an unfortunate turn of events; and Uncle Al, the devious, sinister mastermind behind the circus's success.  As brilliant as these people are, it is also the animals who must be lauded:  Bobo the chimp, Silver Star the dying horse, Rex the lion who is afraid to leave his cage, and Rosie the elephant, who shows more intelligence than many a human could hope to possess.Told in chapters that alternate between the circus life and Jacob's current existence in a nursing home, this story is marvelous.
